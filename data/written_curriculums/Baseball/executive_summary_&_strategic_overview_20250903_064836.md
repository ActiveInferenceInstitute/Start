## **Executive Summary & Strategic Overview**

### **Why Active Inference Matters in Baseball**

Active Inference (AI) provides a formal framework explaining how players, coaches, and systems anticipate, learn, and adapt under uncertainty by minimizing prediction errors (“free energy”). This unifies perception, decision-making, motor control, and learning processes key to baseball performance, scouting, and management. AI enhances strategic decision-making, player development, injury prevention, and analytics integration. It supports data-driven coaching and adaptive gameplay under uncertainty, driving innovation through predictive modeling of player behavior and game dynamics, and providing a competitive advantage.

## **Core Active Inference Material**

### **Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge**

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. **Active Inference** extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### **Theoretical Foundations**

- **Free Energy Principle (FEP):** Biological systems act to minimize variational free energy.
- **Active Inference:** Organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

### **Mathematical Framework**

The mathematical foundation of AI rests on variational inference and information theory, using constructs like variational free energy, expected free energy, and precision matrices.

### **Active Inference Theory**

AI theory integrates perception, action, and learning through the lens of free energy minimization. It explains how organisms adapt to their environment, make decisions, and learn from experience.
