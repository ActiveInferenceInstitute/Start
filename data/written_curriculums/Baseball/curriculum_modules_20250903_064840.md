## Foundational Framework Development

### 1.1 Baseball Domain Concept Mapping

- **Mapping familiar baseball concepts (anticipation, biomechanics, player psychology, strategy) to Active Inference principles of perception, action, prediction, and learning**: 
  - **Anticipation in Baseball**: Anticipation is crucial in baseball, particularly for batters and fielders. Using Active Inference, anticipation can be understood through the lens of Bayesian inference, where batters and fielders update their beliefs about the pitch or ball trajectory based on sensory information.
  - **Biomechanics and Active Inference**: Biomechanics in baseball can be related to the concept of precision in Active Inference. For example, a pitcher's biomechanics can affect the precision of their pitch, influencing the batter's prediction error.
  - **Player Psychology and Active Inference**: Player psychology can be linked to the concept of prior beliefs in Active Inference. A player's prior beliefs about their abilities or the game's situation can influence their actions and decisions.

- **Analogies: Pitch prediction as Bayesian inference; scouting as hierarchical model updating; game strategy as policy optimization.**
  - **Pitch Prediction**: Predicting a pitch's trajectory or type can be seen as a Bayesian inference problem, where the batter updates their beliefs based on prior knowledge and sensory information.
  - **Scouting**: Scouting can be viewed as hierarchical model updating, where coaches and scouts update their models of a player's or team's abilities based on new information.

### 1.2 Accessible Mathematical Foundations

- **Introduction to probabilistic reasoning, Bayesian inference, and concepts of uncertainty using baseball data examples (e.g., pitch success probabilities, player stats)**: 
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning in Baseball**: Probabilistic reasoning can be applied to understanding pitch success probabilities, player performance statistics, and game outcomes.

### 1.3 Cognitive Systems & Decision-Making in Baseball

- **Systems thinking: Viewing team dynamics, player development, and season planning as hierarchical, interacting systems**: 
  - **Team Dynamics**: Team dynamics can be understood as a hierarchical system, where individual players' actions and decisions interact to produce team-level outcomes.

### 1.4 Historical & Theoretical Context

- **Overview of Free Energy Principle origins and evolution of Active Inference theory**: 
  - **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: The FEP is a theoretical framework that explains how biological systems maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.

## Core Principles & Mechanisms

### 2.1 Free Energy Principle Deep Dive

- **Detailed explanation of free energy minimization in biological and artificial systems**: 
  - **Free Energy Minimization**: Free energy minimization is a core concept in the FEP, where biological systems act to minimize their free energy.

### 2.2 Active Inference Architecture

- **Perception and inference as adaptive observation of game events and player states**: 
  - **Perception and Inference in Baseball**: Perception and inference in baseball can be understood through the lens of Active Inference, where players adaptively observe game events and player states to make decisions.

### 2.3 Mechanistic and Computational Implementation

- **Message passing and belief propagation concepts with baseball-specific illustrations**: 
  - **Message Passing in Baseball**: Message passing can be applied to understanding how information is communicated between players, coaches, and teams.

## Extensive Domain Applications & Case Studies

### Anticipation & Prediction

- **Modeling batter/pitcher interactions, intercepting pitches through predictive coding**: 
  - **Batter/Pitcher Interactions**: The interaction between batters and pitchers can be modeled using predictive coding, where batters predict the pitch trajectory and pitchers try to disrupt these predictions.

## Hands-On Implementation Laboratory

### Programming Skills

- **Tutorials in Python (focus on pymdp), R, or MATLAB workflows for Active Inference modeling**: 
  - **Python Tutorials**: Tutorials using Python and the pymdp library can provide hands-on experience with Active Inference modeling.

## Professional Integration & Career Development

### Embedding Active Inference skills into coaching, scouting, analytics, and management roles

- **Strategies for organizational adoption of AI principles and technology**: 
  - **Organizational Adoption**: Strategies for organizational adoption of AI principles and technology can include education and training programs, pilot projects, and leadership support.

## Assessment & Certification

### Formative quizzes testing conceptual understanding and applied reasoning

- **Summative project evaluations with real baseball data analysis**: 
  - **Project Evaluations**: Project evaluations can assess learners' ability to apply Active Inference concepts to real-world baseball data analysis.

## Conclusion

The integration of Active Inference with baseball provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the game, from anticipation and prediction to decision-making and strategy. By applying these concepts, learners can develop a deeper understanding of the game and improve their skills in various roles, from coaching and scouting to analytics and management.
