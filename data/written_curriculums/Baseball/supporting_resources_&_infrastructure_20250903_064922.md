### Active Inference and Baseball: A Comprehensive Curriculum

## Introduction to Active Inference
Active Inference is a theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. This framework has been applied to various fields, including neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.

### Free Energy Principle
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.
