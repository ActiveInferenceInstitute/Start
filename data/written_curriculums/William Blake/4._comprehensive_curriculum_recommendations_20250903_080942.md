## Detailed Curriculum

### Module 1: Introduction to Active Inference & FEP

Active Inference is a theoretical framework that combines perception, action, and learning under a unified umbrella. It posits that biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides the theoretical backbone, suggesting that systems act to minimize variational free energy, a mathematical construct bounding the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

### Module 2: Foundations of Neuroscience & Cognitive Science

Understanding basic brain functions, perception, and action is crucial. Emphasize embodied cognition, which suggests that cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions. This module will cover:

- **Cortical Hierarchy:** Explaining laminar structure and connectivity patterns.
- **Attention:** Precision-weighted prediction error processing.
- **Consciousness:** Global workspace through hierarchical inference.

### Module 3: Probability & Bayesian Reasoning

Bayesian inference and hierarchical models are essential for understanding Active Inference. This module covers:

- **Bayesian Inference:** Updating beliefs about environmental states.
- **Hierarchical Models:** Multi-level prediction and error correction.
- **Uncertainty:** Handling uncertainty through probabilistic reasoning.

### Module 4: Variational Free Energy & Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of Active Inference rests on variational inference and information theory. Key concepts include:

- **Variational Free Energy:** Bounding the surprise of sensory observations.
- **Precision Matrices:** Weighting of prediction errors.
- **Message Passing:** Belief propagation in hierarchical models.

### Module 5: Computational Tools and Programming Basics

Hands-on programming skills are essential. This module introduces:

- **Python/MATLAB:** Basics of programming.
- **pymdp:** Tutorials on Active Inference implementation.

### Module 6: Applications in Neuroscience and AI

Active Inference has applications in neuroscience and AI. This module reviews:

- **Empirical Findings:** Case studies in neuroscience.
- **AI Applications:** Reinforcement learning, anomaly detection.

### Module 7: Cross-disciplinary Integration

Active Inference integrates insights from philosophy of mind, arts, and embodiment. This module explores:

- **Philosophy of Mind:** Extended cognition and predictive processing.
- **Arts:** Symbolic systems and creative expression.

### Module 8: Capstone Project

The capstone project involves designing and implementing a simple model or artistic interpretation using Active Inference. This project promotes creative and scientific synthesis.
