Read introductory papers (Clark, 2013; Hohwy, 2013)\n2. Study mathematical foundations (Friston, 2010; Parr & Friston, 2019)  \n3. Understand hierarchical predictive coding (Friston, 2008)\n4. Learn Bayesian inference basics (Bishop, 2006)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Free Energy Principle and Active Inference represent a paradigmatic shift in understanding biological intelligence, offering a unified framework that bridges neuroscience, artificial intelligence, psychology, and philosophy."
