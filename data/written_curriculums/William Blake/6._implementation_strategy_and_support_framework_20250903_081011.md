# 6. Implementation Strategy and Support Framework

## Section Name: 6. Implementation Strategy and Support Framework

## Target Audience: William Blake

## Structured Onboarding:

Welcome, William Blake, to the 6. Implementation Strategy and Support Framework section. This section is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Active Inference and its practical applications, tailored to your interests and needs.

### Learning Objectives:

1. Understand the principles of Active Inference and its relevance to your work.
2. Learn how to develop an implementation strategy for Active Inference in your professional context.
3. Familiarize yourself with support frameworks for successful implementation.

### Curated Resource Bundles:

The following resource bundles are curated for each learning phase:

1. **Theoretical Foundation:**
	* "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" (Parr, Pezzulo, Friston)
	* "Surfing Uncertainty: Prediction, Action, and the Embodied Mind" (Clark)
2. **Mathematical Framework:**
	* "Variational Autoencoders" (Kingma & Welling)
	* "Reinforcement Learning" (Sutton & Barto)
3. **Practical Implementation:**
	* "pymdp" (Python package for Active Inference)
	* "SPM" (Statistical Parametric Mapping software)

### Regular Check-ins:

Regular check-ins will be scheduled to assess progress and adapt the curriculum as needed.

### Connections to Active Inference Communities:

* Active Inference Institute
* Free Energy Principle Community

### Flexible Scheduling:

Flexible scheduling will be accommodated to allow for reflective, non-linear learning.

### Feedback Systems:

Feedback systems will be established for iterative course improvement.

## Core Active Inference Material:

The core Active Inference material will cover the theoretical foundations, mathematical framework, and practical implementation of Active Inference.

## Learning Modalities:

The learning modalities will include text, images, videos, and interactive simulations.

## Assessment and Evaluation:

Assessment and evaluation will be ongoing throughout the section, with opportunities for feedback and improvement.

## Implementation Strategy:

The implementation strategy will be developed based on the learning objectives and will include practical projects and case studies.

## Support Framework:

The support framework will include regular check-ins, feedback systems, and connections to Active Inference communities.

By following this comprehensive curriculum section, you will gain a deep understanding of Active Inference and its practical applications, and develop the skills and knowledge necessary to implement Active Inference in your professional context.
