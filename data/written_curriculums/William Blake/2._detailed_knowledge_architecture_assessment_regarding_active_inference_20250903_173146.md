### 1. Theoretical Foundation

#### Overview of Active Inference and Free Energy Principle
- **Definition**: Active Inference is a theoretical framework that extends the Free Energy Principle (FEP) by incorporating action as a means to minimize expected free energy.
- **Core Concepts**: Variational free energy, prediction error, hierarchical inference, embodied cognition.

#### Historical Context and Key Researchers
- **Founders**: Karl Friston, Andy Clark, and others.
- **Influential Works**: Friston's papers on FEP and Active Inference.

### 2. Mathematical Framework

#### Variational Free Energy
- **Mathematical Definition**: \( F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)] \)
- **Components**: Recognition density \( q(x) \), prior beliefs \( p(x|m) \), joint density \( p(x,y|m) \).

#### Expected Free Energy
- **Formula**: \( G = E_q[ln q(π) - ln p(o,π|m)] - E_q[ln p(o|π,m)] \)
- **Epistemic and Pragmatic Value**: Exploration vs. exploitation.

### 3. Practical Applications

#### Neuroscience Applications
- **Brain Function**: Cortical hierarchy, attention, and consciousness.
- **Clinical Applications**: Psychosis, depression, autism.

#### Artificial Intelligence
- **Machine Learning**: Variational autoencoders, reinforcement learning.
- **Robotics**: Sensorimotor control and navigation.

### 4. Case Studies and Projects

#### Case Study 1: Active Inference in Robotics
- **Background**: Autonomous navigation.
- **Methodology**: Implementation of Active Inference for path planning.
- **Results**: Efficient navigation with reduced uncertainty.

#### Project: Implementing Active Inference
