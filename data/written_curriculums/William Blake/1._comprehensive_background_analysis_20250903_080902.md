## Curriculum Section: William Blake through the Lens of Active Inference

### Learning Objectives

- Understand William Blake's personal and professional profile
- Analyze Blake's intellectual and cognitive profile
- Explore Blake's learning and development patterns
- Examine Blake's motivational and value systems
- Apply Active Inference principles to Blake's life and work

### Personal and Professional Profile

William Blake was a poet, painter, and engraver from London. His main occupations were poetry, painting, and engraving, through which he expressed visionary and mystical themes.

### Intellectual and Cognitive Profile

Blake's expertise spans poetry, fine art, spiritual visionary insight, and philosophical critique of reason and institutional dogma. His work reveals a holistic, symbolic cognitive style privileging visionary metaphor, archetypal narratives, and embodied symbolic experience.

### Learning and Development Patterns

Blake was largely self-taught in classical languages and preferred informal, experiential learning over formal structures. He was an early adopter of print technology for engraving and book production.

### Motivational and Value Systems

Blake's core motivations include artistic and visionary expression, spiritual insight, social justice, and personal and creative freedom. His values include opposition to institutional oppression, advocacy of equality, and pursuit of transcendent truth.

### Core Active Inference Material

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

### Theoretical Foundations

The FEP builds upon several foundational theories, including Helmholtz's Unconscious Inference, Predictive Coding, Bayesian Brain Hypothesis, Information Theory, Cybernetics, and more.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on variational inference and information theory. The variational free energy (F) is a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy. It explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Applications and Domains

Active Inference has applications in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, psychology, and cognitive science.

### Key Researchers and Contributors

Key researchers include Karl J. Friston, Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and more.

### Seminal Papers and Publications

Seminal papers include "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?" by Friston (2010), "Active inference: a process theory" by Friston et al. (2017), and more.

### Educational Resources

Educational resources include books, online courses, lectures, interactive tools, and simulations.

### Software and Computational Tools

Software and computational tools include pymdp, SPM, DEM Toolbox, VBA Toolbox, and more.

### Research Communities and Networks

Research communities and networks include the Free Energy Principle community, Active Inference Institute, Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, and more.

### Current Research Directions

Current research directions include theoretical developments, empirical research, clinical translation, and technology applications.

### Cross-Disciplinary Connections

Cross-disciplinary connections include philosophy of mind, physics and information theory, economics and decision theory, biology and evolution, and more.

### Practical Implementation

Practical implementation involves getting started with Active Inference, model development workflow, best practices, and continuous improvement.

## Conclusion

The comprehensive curriculum section on William Blake through the lens of Active Inference provides an extensive educational content that thoroughly prepares learners to understand, apply, and innovate with the covered concepts in their specific professional context.
