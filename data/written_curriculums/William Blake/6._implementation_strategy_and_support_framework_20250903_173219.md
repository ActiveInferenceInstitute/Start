# 6. Implementation Strategy and Support Framework

## Introduction
The implementation strategy and support framework section is designed to provide a structured approach to implementing Active Inference in various domains, tailored to William Blake's perspective on mind and vision. This section aims to contextualize Active Inference, offer curated resource bundles, plan regular check-ins, establish connections to Active Inference communities, and enable flexible scheduling.

## Structured Onboarding
To begin, let's contextualize Active Inference through Blakeâ€™s approach to mind and vision. Active Inference is a theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Blake's works, such as "The Tyger" and "The Lamb," reflect his deep understanding of the human mind and its creative potential.

## Curated Resource Bundles
The following curated resource bundles are tailored to each learning phase:

1. **Theoretical Foundations:** 
   - "The Free Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?" by Karl J. Friston
   - "Surfing Uncertainty: Prediction, Action, and the Embodied Mind" by Andy Clark

2. **Mathematical Framework:**
   - "The free-energy principle: a rough guide to the brain?" by Karl J. Friston
   - "Generalised free energy and active inference" by Thomas Parr and Karl J. Friston

3. **Active Inference Theory:**
   - "Active inference: a process theory" by Karl J. Friston, Thomas FitzGerald, Francesco Rigoli, Philipp Schwartenbeck, and Giovanni Pezzulo
   - "The Anatomy of Inference" by Karl J. Friston

## Regular Check-Ins
Regular check-ins will be scheduled to assess progress and adapt the curriculum as needed. This will ensure that the learning process is effective and engaging.

## Active Inference Communities
Connections to Active Inference communities, such as the Active Inference Institute, will be established to provide support and resources for learners.

## Flexible Scheduling
Flexible scheduling will be used to accommodate reflective, non-linear learning. Learners will have the opportunity to explore the material at their own pace and revisit concepts as needed.

## Feedback Systems
Feedback systems will be enabled to facilitate iterative course improvement. Learners will be encouraged to provide feedback on the curriculum and suggest areas for improvement.

## Core Active Inference Material
The core Active Inference material will cover the Free Energy Principle, mathematical framework, Active Inference theory, applications, and key researchers and contributors.

## Applications and Domains
The applications and domains section will explore the use of Active Inference in various fields, including neuroscience, artificial intelligence, psychology, and more.

## Educational Resources
Educational resources, including books, online courses, and interactive tools, will be provided to support learners.

## Software and Computational Tools
Software and computational tools, such as SPM and pymdp, will be introduced to facilitate implementation.

## Research Communities and Networks
Research communities and networks, including the Active Inference Institute, will be introduced to provide learners with opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Current Research Directions
Current research directions, including theoretical developments, empirical research, and technology applications, will be discussed.

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
Cross-disciplinary connections, including philosophy of mind, physics and information theory, economics and decision theory, biology and evolution, will be explored.

## Practical Implementation
Practical implementation guidance will be provided, including getting started with Active Inference, model development workflow, and best practices.

## Conclusion
The implementation strategy and support framework section provides a comprehensive approach to implementing Active Inference in various domains. By contextualizing Active Inference, offering curated resource bundles, planning regular check-ins, establishing connections to Active Inference communities, and enabling flexible scheduling, learners will be well-equipped to understand and apply Active Inference in their professional context.
