## 6. Implementation Strategy and Support Framework 

### Structured Onboarding
To contextualize Active Inference through William Blake's approach to mind and vision, consider the following onboarding structure:

1. **Introduction to Active Inference**: Provide a foundational overview of Active Inference, emphasizing its relevance to Blake's philosophical and artistic contributions.
2. **Blake's Approach to Mind and Vision**: Explore Blake's views on perception, creativity, and the nature of reality, highlighting connections to Active Inference principles.
3. **Curated Resource Bundles**: Offer tailored resource bundles for each learning phase, including articles, videos, and software tools.

### Curated Resource Bundles
The following resource bundles are tailored to each learning phase:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: 
   - "Active Inference: A Process Theory" by Karl J. Friston et al. (2017)
   - "The Free Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?" by Karl J. Friston (2010)

2. **Mathematical Framework**:
   - "The free-energy principle: a rough guide to the brain?" by Karl J. Friston (2009)
   - "Generalised free energy and active inference" by Thomas Parr and Karl J. Friston (2019)

3. **Practical Implementation**:
   - "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and Karl J. Friston (2022)
   - "Surfing Uncertainty: Prediction, Action, and the Embodied Mind" by Andy Clark (2016)

### Regular Check-Ins
Schedule regular check-ins for progress assessment and curriculum adaptation:

1. **Weekly Progress Meetings**: Meet weekly to discuss progress, address questions, and adapt the curriculum as needed.
2. **Bi-Weekly Reflection Sessions**: Hold bi-weekly sessions for reflection, feedback, and discussion of challenges and insights.

### Active Inference Communities
Establish connections to Active Inference communities for support:

1. **Active Inference Institute**: Engage with the Active Inference Institute for access to resources, software, and community support.
2. **Predictive Processing Community**: Participate in predictive processing forums and discussions.

### Flexible Scheduling
Use flexible scheduling to accommodate reflective, non-linear learning:

1. **Self-Paced Learning**: Allow learners to progress at their own pace, with regular check-ins and support.
2. **Flexible Time Slots**: Offer flexible time slots for meetings, discussions, and check-ins.

### Feedback Systems
Enable feedback systems for iterative course improvement:

1. **Feedback Forms**: Provide feedback forms for learners to provide suggestions and comments.
2. **Regular Feedback Sessions**: Hold regular sessions to discuss feedback and implement changes.

### Core Active Inference Material
The core Active Inference material includes:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Understand the theoretical foundations of Active Inference and its connection to Blake's approach.
2. **Mathematical Framework**: Develop a deep understanding of the mathematical framework of Active Inference.
