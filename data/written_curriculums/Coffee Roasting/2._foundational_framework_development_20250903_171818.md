# 2. Foundational Framework Development

# Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Foundational Framework Development
## Section Introduction

This curriculum section provides a foundational framework for coffee roasting professionals, introducing the concept of Active Inference and its application in the coffee roasting industry. Active Inference is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the concept of Active Inference and its relevance to coffee roasting.
2. Apply Active Inference principles to roast curve prediction and real-time temperature and airflow adjustments.
3. Develop cognitive frameworks for roasting as a feedback-driven hierarchical process.
4. Analyze historical and theoretical contexts of classical sensory evaluation and manual profile adjustment.

## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

**Core Tenets:**

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
- **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

### Mathematical Foundations

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
4. **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence

## Applications in Coffee Roasting

### Roast Curve Prediction

- **Active Perception**: Roast curve prediction as active perception
- **Minimizing Prediction Errors**: Real-time temperature and airflow adjustments

### Real-Time Adjustments

- **Hierarchical Process**: Roasting as a feedback-driven hierarchical process
- **Probabilistic Modelling**: Adaptive roasting strategies based on probabilistic modelling
