2. **pymdp Tutorials**: Hands-on tutorials on using pymdp for modeling and simulating coffee roasting processes.
3. **Data Interfaces**: Integration with data logging systems for temperature curves, rate of rise, and airflow adjustments.

### Example Code

```python
import pymdp

# Define the model
model = pymdp.models.FreeEnergyModel()

# Simulate a roasting batch
batch_data = model.simulate_roasting_batch(
    initial_temperature=20,
    target_temperature=200,
    heating_rate=10
)

# Visualize the temperature curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(batch_data['temperature_curve'])
plt.xlabel('Time (minutes)')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (째C)')
plt.title('Roasting Batch Temperature Curve')
plt.show()
```
