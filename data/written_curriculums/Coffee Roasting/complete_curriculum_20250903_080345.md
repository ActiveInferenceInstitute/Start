## Theoretical Foundations

### Introduction to Active Inference

Active Inference is a theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. In the context of coffee roasting, Active Inference can be applied to optimize the roasting process, ensuring consistent quality and flavor.

### Key Concepts

* **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: A unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.
* **Active Inference**: An extension of FEP that proposes organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.
* **Markov Blankets**: Statistical boundaries that separate internal states from external environment.
* **Variational Density**: Internal probabilistic model of external states.

### Historical Context

The FEP builds upon several foundational theories:

* **Helmholtz's Unconscious Inference** (1867): Perception as unconscious probabilistic inference.
* **Predictive Coding** (Rao & Ballard, 1999): Neural processing as prediction error minimization.
* **Bayesian Brain Hypothesis** (Knill & Pouget, 2004): Brain as Bayesian inference machine.

## Mathematical Framework

### Variational Free Energy

The mathematical foundation of Active Inference rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

* `F` = Variational Free Energy
* `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
* `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
* `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states

### Expected Free Energy

For Active Inference, organisms minimize **expected free energy** (G):

```mathematical
G = E_q[ln q(π) - ln p(o,π|m)] - E_q[ln p(o|π,m)]
```

Components:

* **Epistemic value**: Information gain (exploration)
* **Pragmatic value**: Prior preference satisfaction (exploitation)

## Practical Applications

### Optimizing Coffee Roasting Processes

Active Inference can be applied to optimize coffee roasting processes by:

* **Modeling Roasting Profiles**: Using probabilistic models to predict optimal roasting profiles.
* **Quality Control**: Monitoring and controlling roasting processes to ensure consistent quality.
* **Customer Satisfaction**: Analyzing customer preferences and adjusting roasting profiles accordingly.

### Case Studies

* **Case Study 1**: A coffee roasting company applies Active Inference to optimize their roasting process, resulting in improved quality and customer satisfaction.
* **Case Study 2**: A coffee roasting company uses Active Inference to analyze customer preferences and adjust their roasting profiles, resulting in increased sales.
