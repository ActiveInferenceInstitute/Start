## 2. Foundational Framework Development

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand the Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: Explain the core tenets of FEP and its implications for biological systems.
2. **Apply Active Inference**: Describe how Active Inference extends FEP and its applications in real-world scenarios.
3. **Analyze Systems Thinking**: Augment systems thinking around roasting as a feedback-driven hierarchical process.
4. **Develop Cognitive Frameworks**: Create problem-solving strategies using Active Inference and probabilistic modeling.

### Conceptual Bridge-Building

Introduce Active Inference via analogies familiar to roasting professionals:

- **Roast Curve Prediction as Active Perception**: Adjusting roast curves based on real-time temperature and airflow data can be seen as active perception, where the roaster actively engages with the environment to minimize prediction errors.
- **Real-Time Adjustments as Minimizing Prediction Errors**: Making adjustments to temperature and airflow to achieve desired roast profiles illustrates the concept of minimizing prediction errors.

### Mathematical Foundations

Present core mathematical constructs using roasting domain data:

- **Variational Free Energy**: Explain how bean temperature curves represent latent states and how prediction errors relate to deviations from desired roast profiles.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Use intuitive visuals for key concepts like rate of rise (RoR) and temperature setpoints.

### Cognitive Framework Development

Augment systems thinking around roasting as a feedback-driven hierarchical process:

- **Sensory, Chemical, and Mechanical Data Integration**: Emphasize the importance of integrating sensory, chemical, and mechanical data in roasting.
- **Active Inference as a Conceptual Expansion**: Use Active Inference as a framework for adaptive roasting strategies based on probabilistic modeling.

### Historical & Theoretical Context

Trace the progression from classical sensory evaluation and manual profile adjustment to AI-driven, predictive roasting control:

- **Classical Sensory Evaluation**: Discuss the limitations of traditional sensory evaluation methods.
- **Manual Profile Adjustment**: Explain how manual adjustments have been used to achieve desired roast profiles.
- **AI-Driven Predictive Roasting Control**: Introduce how AI and machine learning have enabled predictive roasting control embodying Active Inference principles.

### Core Active Inference Material

#### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

- **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: A unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.
- **Active Inference**: Extends FEP by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

#### Mathematical Framework

- **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
- **Expected Free Energy**: A mathematical framework for understanding the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

#### Active Inference Theory

- **Core Principles**: Perception, action, and learning as unified processes.
- **Process Theory**: A process theory with components including perceptual inference, active sampling, policy selection, and precision control.

#### Applications and Domains

- **Neuroscience Applications**: Brain function, attention, consciousness, and psychiatric disorders.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning, robotics, anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning.
- **Psychology and Cognitive Science**: Cognitive processes, developmental psychology, and social cognition.

#### Key Researchers and Contributors
