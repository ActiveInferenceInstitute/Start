## 8. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

### Introduction

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is a critical component of the curriculum, designed to ensure that learners have a deep understanding of the theoretical concepts and practical applications of Active Inference in the context of coffee roasting. This framework includes formative quizzes, practical project evaluations, peer-reviewed case study analyses, and a final capstone presentation.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand Theoretical Concepts**: Explain key Active Inference principles and their relevance to coffee roasting.
2. **Apply Practical Skills**: Implement Active Inference in roast profile optimization exercises.
3. **Analyze Case Studies**: Critically evaluate peer-reviewed case studies on Active Inference applications in coffee roasting.
4. **Integrate Multi-Level Applications**: Design and present a capstone project integrating Active Inference in coffee roasting.

### Formative Quizzes

**Quiz 1: Theoretical Foundations**
- **Topics Covered**: Free Energy Principle, Active Inference basics
