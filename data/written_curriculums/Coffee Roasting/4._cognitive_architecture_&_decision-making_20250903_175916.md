# 4. Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making

## Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making: A Comprehensive Curriculum Section

### Section Introduction

This curriculum section provides a comprehensive exploration of cognitive architecture and decision-making through the lens of Active Inference. Tailored specifically for coffee roasters, this section aims to enhance understanding and application of mental models, problem-solving strategies, cognitive biases, and collaborative intelligence in the context of coffee roasting.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Apply Mental Models**: Utilize frameworks centered on the transformation of raw beans by heat and time, emphasizing cause-effect sequences in chemical changes during roasting.
2. **Develop Problem-Solving Strategies**: Make analytical adjustments to roasting profiles based on sensory and chemical analysis, and refine intuitive approaches informed by experience.
3. **Recognize Cognitive Biases**: Identify and mitigate confirmation bias, expertise leading to potential overconfidence in sensory judgment, and shortcuts in causal attribution for flavor changes without data.
4. **Foster Collaborative Intelligence**: Understand team roles in production, quality, and R&D, and promote clear communication channels between roasters and supply chain partners.

### Core Active Inference Material

#### Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

**Theoretical Foundations:**

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states.
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference.
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Markov Blankets**: Statistical boundaries separating internal states from the external environment.
- **Variational Density**: Internal probabilistic model of external states.
- **Precision**: Confidence or reliability of predictions and observations.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of FEP and Active Inference rests on variational inference and information theory.

**Variational Free Energy:**

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

**Core Principles:**

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.
