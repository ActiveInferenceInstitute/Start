# 4. Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making

# Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making: A Comprehensive Curriculum Section

## Introduction
This curriculum section is designed to provide a thorough exploration of cognitive architecture and decision-making, tailored for coffee roasters. The focus will be on developing a deep understanding of mental models, problem-solving strategies, cognitive biases, and collaborative intelligence, all through the lens of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the transformation of raw beans by heat and time, emphasizing cause-effect sequences in chemical changes during roasting.
- Develop analytical adjustments to roasting profiles based on sensory and chemical analysis.
- Apply intuitive refinements informed by experience and systems thinking to anticipate crop variability and roasting impacts.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Mental Models & Conceptual Frameworks
Frameworks centered on the transformation of raw beans by heat and time, emphasizing cause-effect sequences in chemical changes during roasting. Metaphors related to cooking and chemistry will be explored, along with categorization by roasting levels (light, medium, dark) and flavor profiles.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- Analytical adjustments to roasting profiles based on sensory and chemical analysis.
- Intuitive refinements informed by experience.
- Systems thinking to anticipate crop variability and roasting impacts.

### Cognitive Biases & Limitations
- Confirmation bias toward traditional roasting methods.
- Expertise leading to potential overconfidence in sensory judgment.
- Shortcuts in causal attribution for flavor changes without data.

### Collaborative Intelligence
- Team roles in production, quality, and R&D.
- Clear communication channels between roasters and supply chain partners.

## Active Inference and Decision-Making
The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference provide a unifying theoretical framework for understanding biological systems, cognition, and decision-making. This section will explore the application of these concepts to coffee roasting, including:

## Free Energy Principle (FEP)
The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize variational free energy, a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

### Active Inference Theory
Active Inference extends FEP by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

## Mathematical Framework
The mathematical foundation of FEP and Active Inference rests on variational inference and information theory. The variational free energy (F) is bounded by:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states

### Applications and Domains
Applications of FEP and Active Inference include neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and psychology. In coffee roasting, these concepts can be applied to:

- **Roast Profile Optimization:** Using Active Inference to optimize roast profiles for desired flavor profiles.
- **Sensory Evaluation:** Applying FEP to understand sensory perception and decision-making in coffee roasting.
