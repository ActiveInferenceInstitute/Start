The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference are theoretical frameworks that have been widely adopted in various fields, including neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. The core idea behind these frameworks is to provide a unified explanation of brain function, cognition, and behavior.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

**Core Tenets:**

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
- **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

### Active Inference

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
4. **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence

### Applications and Domains

### Neuroscience Applications

#### Brain Function

- **Cortical Hierarchy**: Explaining laminar structure and connectivity patterns
- **Attention**: Precision-weighted prediction error processing
- **Consciousness**: Global workspace through hierarchical inference
- **Psychiatric Disorders**: Altered precision and false inference in psychosis, depression, autism

### Artificial Intelligence

#### Machine Learning

- **Variational Autoencoders**: Deep generative models inspired by FEP
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy optimization through expected utility
- **Continual Learning**: Catastrophic forgetting prevention through generative replay
- **Anomaly Detection**: Novelty detection through surprise minimization

## Mathematical Framework

### Variational Free Energy

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

### Expected Free Energy

For Active Inference, organisms minimize **expected free energy** (G):

```mathematical
G = E_q[ln q(π) - ln p(o,π|m)] - E_q[ln p(o|π,m)]
```

Components:

- **Epistemic value**: Information gain (exploration)
- **Pragmatic value**: Prior preference satisfaction (exploitation)
