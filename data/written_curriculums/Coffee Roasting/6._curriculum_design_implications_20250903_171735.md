### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand the Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: Explain the foundational concepts of FEP and its implications for biological and artificial systems.
2. **Apply Active Inference**: Describe how Active Inference extends FEP and its applications in perception, action, and learning.
3. **Analyze Case Studies**: Evaluate real-world applications of FEP and Active Inference in various domains, including neuroscience, AI, and psychology.
4. **Design Implementation Frameworks**: Develop practical frameworks for implementing Active Inference in professional contexts.
5. **Reflect and Evaluate**: Critically assess the strengths, limitations, and future directions of FEP and Active Inference.
