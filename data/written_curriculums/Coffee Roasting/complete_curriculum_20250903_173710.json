Implement variational message passing and belief propagation using roasting software data and AI system inputs.\n\n## Free Energy Principle (FEP) Deep Dive\n\nThe FEP posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. In the context of coffee roasting, the FEP can be translated into thermodynamic and informational terms. Roasting can be modeled as minimizing \"surprise\" in bean chemistry transformations and flavor profiles, akin to regulating temperature homeostasis inside the roaster.\n\n### Thermodynamic and Informational Terms\n\nThe FEP can be understood through thermodynamic and informational terms, including:\n\n* **Entropy**: A measure of disorder or uncertainty in a system.\n* **Energy Efficiency**: The efficiency with which energy is converted into useful work.\n* **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.\n\n## Active Inference Process Architecture\n\nThe Active Inference process architecture consists of:\n\n1. **Perception/Inferences**: How roasting sensors and profiles inform internal probabilistic models of bean status.\n2. **Action/Planning**: Dynamic roasting parameter adjustments to minimize expected free energy.\n3. **Learning/Adaptation**: Updating roast profile models based on batch performance and sensory feedback.\n\n### Perception/Inferences\n\nPerception and inference play a crucial role in the Active Inference process. Roasting sensors and profiles inform internal probabilistic models of bean status, enabling the system to make predictions and adjust parameters accordingly.\n\n### Action/Planning\n\nDynamic roasting parameter adjustments are made to minimize expected free energy. This includes adjustments to airflow, drum speed, and other parameters to optimize the roasting process.\n\n### Learning/Adaptation\n\nThe system updates roast profile models based on batch performance and sensory feedback. This enables the system to adapt to changing conditions and improve performance over time.\n\n## Implementation Mechanisms\n\nImplementation mechanisms for the Active Inference process include:\n\n* **Variational Message Passing**: An algorithm for inference and learning in probabilistic models.\n* **Belief Propagation**: An algorithm for distributed computation of marginal distributions.\n\n### Variational Message Passing\n\nVariational message passing is an algorithm for inference and learning in probabilistic models. It can be used to implement the Active Inference process in coffee roasting.\n\n### Belief Propagation\n\nBelief propagation is an algorithm for distributed computation of marginal distributions. It can be used to implement the Active Inference process in coffee roasting.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference provide a comprehensive framework for understanding coffee roasting. By applying these principles, coffee roasters can optimize their roasting processes, improve product quality, and reduce energy consumption.\n\n### References\n\n* Friston, K. J. (2010).
