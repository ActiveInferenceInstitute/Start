2. Implement Active Inference models using Python (pymdp) and analyze data.
3. Optimize coffee roasting processes using Active Inference.
4. Evaluate the performance of Active Inference models in coffee roasting.

### Computational Skills

#### Programming Tutorials

This section includes programming tutorials focused on Python (pymdp), roasting data interfaces, and visualization tools for temperature curves, rate of rise, and airflow adjustments.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pymdp import agent

# Define the agent
agent = agent.Agent()

# Define the environment
env = agent.Environment()

# Run the simulation
agent.run(env)

# Plot the results
plt.plot(agent.states)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('State')
plt.title('Agent States')
plt.show()
```

#### Roasting Data Interfaces

This section includes tutorials on how to interface with roasting data, including data loading, processing, and visualization.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('roasting_data.csv')

# Process the data
data['temperature'] = data['temperature'] * 1.8 + 32

# Plot the data
plt.plot(data['time'], data['temperature'])
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')
plt.title('Roasting Temperature Curve')
plt.show()
```

#### Visualization Tools

This section includes tutorials on how to visualize temperature curves, rate of rise, and airflow adjustments.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the data
temperature_curve = np.array([200, 210, 220, 230, 240])
rate_of_rise = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
airflow_adjustments = np.array([100, 200, 300, 400, 500])

# Plot the data
plt.plot(temperature_curve)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')
plt.title('Temperature Curve')
plt.show()

plt.plot(rate_of_rise)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Rate of Rise')
plt.title('Rate of Rise Curve')
plt.show()

plt.plot(airflow_adjustments)

This section includes tutorials on how to design and conduct roasting batch experiments, including hypothesis testing with Active Inference models and sensory evaluation protocols correlated with modeled predictions.

```python
import numpy as np
from pymdp import agent

# Define the agent
agent = agent.Agent()

# Define the environment
env = agent.Environment()

# Run the simulation
agent.run(env)

# Evaluate the performance
performance = agent.evaluate(env)

# Print the results
print(performance)
```

#### Sensory Evaluation Protocols

This section includes tutorials on how to design and conduct sensory evaluation protocols, including data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('sensory_data.csv')

# Analyze the data
data['score'] = data['score'] * 1.0

# Plot the data
plt.plot(data['time'], data['score'])
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Sensory Evaluation Curve')
plt.show()
```

### Professional Tools Development

# Define the environment
env = agent.Environment()

# Integrate the inference algorithm
agent.integrate_inference_algorithm(env)
