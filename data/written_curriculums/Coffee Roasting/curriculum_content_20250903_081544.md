## Theoretical Foundations

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) are unifying theoretical frameworks that explain biological systems' behavior. The FEP posits that biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. AI extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

## Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of FEP and AI rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**. The **variational free energy** is a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

## Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy.
