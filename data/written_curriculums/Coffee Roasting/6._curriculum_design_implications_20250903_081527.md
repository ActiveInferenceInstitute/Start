## Active Inference and Free Energy Principle: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

### Executive Summary

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) provide a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. This framework posits that biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Theoretical Foundations

- **Free Energy Principle (FEP):** A unifying theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive.
- **Active Inference (AI):** Extends FEP by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

### Mathematical Framework

- **Variational Free Energy:** A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
- **Expected Free Energy:** A mathematical framework for Active Inference that incorporates action and expected outcomes.

### Active Inference Theory

- **Core Principles:** Perception, action, and learning as unified processes to minimize expected free energy.
- **Process Theory:** A framework that integrates perception, action, and learning through hierarchical inference and message passing.

### Applications and Domains

- **Neuroscience:** Explaining brain function, attention, and perception.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Applications in machine learning, robotics, and anomaly detection.

### Key Researchers and Contributors

- **Karl J. Friston:** Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference.
- **Andy Clark:** Philosopher of mind and cognitive science, known for predictive processing and embodied cognition.
