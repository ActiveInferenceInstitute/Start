### Active Inference Theory and Mathematical Framework

#### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

#### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of Active Inference rests on variational inference and information theory. The variational free energy (F) is a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
