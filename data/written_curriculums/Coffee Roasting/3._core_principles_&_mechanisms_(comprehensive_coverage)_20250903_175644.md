### Core Content

#### Free Energy Principle (FEP) Deep Dive

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. In the context of coffee roasting, the FEP can be applied to model roasting as minimizing "surprise" in bean chemistry transformations and flavor profiles.

* **Thermodynamic and Informational Terms:** Translate FEP into thermodynamic and informational terms grounded in roasting, connecting to entropy and energy efficiency concepts.
* **Entropy and Energy Efficiency:** Explore the relationship between entropy, energy efficiency, and coffee roasting, highlighting the importance of optimizing roasting parameters.

#### Active Inference Process Architecture

The active inference process architecture consists of four main components:

1. **Perception/Inferences:** How roasting sensors and profiles inform internal probabilistic models of bean status.
2. **Action/Planning:** Dynamic roasting parameter adjustments to minimize expected free energy (e.g., airflow, drum speed modifications).
3. **Learning/Adaptation:** Updating roast profile models based on batch performance and sensory feedback.
4. **Precision & Attention:** Weighting reliability of sensory data from temperature vs. aroma sensors.

#### Implementation Mechanisms

Explore variational message passing, belief propagation, and Bayesian updates using roasting software data and AI system inputs to illustrate applied algorithmic mechanisms.

### Practical Applications and Implementation

#### Case Studies

* **Primary Case Study:** A detailed case study on optimizing coffee roasting parameters using FEP and active inference.
