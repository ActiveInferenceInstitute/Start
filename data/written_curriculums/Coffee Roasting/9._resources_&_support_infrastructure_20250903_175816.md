## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

This document provides foundational domain knowledge for Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference research and curriculum development.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

## Mathematical Framework

### Variational Free Energy

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**.

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

### Expected Free Energy

For Active Inference, organisms minimize **expected free energy** (G):

```mathematical
G = E_q[ln q(π) - ln p(o,π|m)] - E_q[ln p(o|π,m)]
```

Components:

- **Epistemic value**: Information gain (exploration)
- **Pragmatic value**: Prior preference satisfaction (exploitation)

## Active Inference Theory

### Core Principles

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
4. **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence

### Process Theory

Active Inference can be understood as a **process theory** with the following components:

**Perception**:

- Hierarchical message passing
- Prediction error minimization
- Belief updating through variational inference

**Action**:

- Motor predictions and proprioceptive inference
- Action as controlled hallucination
- Policy optimization through expected free energy minimization

**Learning**:

- Model parameter updating
- Habit formation through repeated inference
- Structural learning of generative models
