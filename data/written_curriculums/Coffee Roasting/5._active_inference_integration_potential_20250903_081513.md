### Core Active Inference Material

#### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

##### Theoretical Foundations

- **Homeostasis:** Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states.
- **Prediction:** Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference.

##### Mathematical Framework

- **Variational Free Energy:** A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

### Applications and Domains

#### Coffee Roasting Applications

- **Predictive Modeling:** Use Bayesian models to predict roast outcomes.
- **Adaptive Roasting:** Implement algorithms that adjust roasting parameters in real-time.
