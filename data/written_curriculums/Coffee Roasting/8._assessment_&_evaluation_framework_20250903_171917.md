## 8. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

### Introduction

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is a critical component of the coffee roasting curriculum, designed to ensure that learners can effectively apply Active Inference principles in their professional practice. This framework integrates formative quizzes, practical projects, peer-reviewed case studies, and a final capstone presentation to provide a comprehensive assessment of learner competencies.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Apply Active Inference principles**: Contextualize and apply theoretical concepts in coffee roasting scenarios.
2. **Optimize roast profiles**: Use Active Inference to improve roast quality and consistency.
3. **Analyze case studies**: Critically evaluate peer-reviewed case studies and apply insights to their own practice.
4. **Communicate effectively**: Present their understanding and application of Active Inference in a capstone presentation.

### Formative Quizzes

**Theoretical Concepts Quizzes**

1. **Quiz 1: Introduction to Active Inference**
   - Topics: Free Energy Principle, Active Inference basics
   - Format: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and short-answer questions (SAQs)
   - Example: What is the primary goal of Active Inference in coffee roasting?

2. **Quiz 2: Active Inference in Coffee Roasting**
   - Topics: Application of Active Inference in roast profile optimization
   - Format: MCQs, SAQs, and scenario-based questions
   - Example: How would you adjust roast parameters using Active Inference to achieve a desired flavor profile?

**Contextualized Scenario Quizzes**

1. **Quiz 3: Roast Profile Optimization**
   - Scenario: Learners are presented with a roast profile and asked to optimize it using Active Inference principles.
   - Format: Interactive simulation with multiple-choice and short-answer questions.

2. **Quiz 4: Troubleshooting Roast Defects**
   - Scenario: Learners are given a common roast defect and asked to diagnose and correct it using Active Inference.
   - Format: Case study analysis with short-answer questions.

### Practical Project Evaluations

3. **Criteria**:
   - Understanding and application of Active Inference principles.
   - Effectiveness of the optimized roast profile.

**Peer-Reviewed Case Study Analyses**

1. **Objective**: Analyze a peer-reviewed case study on the application of Active Inference in coffee roasting.
2. **Deliverables**:
   - A written analysis of the case study.
   - A presentation summarizing key findings and insights.
3. **Criteria**:
   - Depth of analysis and understanding of Active Inference.
   - Ability to apply insights to own practice.

### Final Capstone Presentation

**Integrating Multi-Level Active Inference Applications**

1. **Objective**: Present a comprehensive application of Active Inference in coffee roasting, integrating concepts learned throughout the curriculum.
2. **Deliverables**:
   - A written report detailing the application.
   - An oral presentation summarizing the project.
3. **Criteria**:
   - Integration of Active Inference principles across multiple levels of coffee roasting.
   - Clarity and effectiveness of the presentation.

### Assessment Criteria
