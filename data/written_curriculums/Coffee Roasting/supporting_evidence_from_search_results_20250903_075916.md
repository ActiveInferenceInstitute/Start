## Supporting Evidence from Search Results: A Coffee Roasting Perspective

### Introduction

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in coffee roasting equipment has revolutionized the industry by enhancing consistency and flavor outcomes. This section explores the application of Active Inference and Free Energy Principle (FEP) in coffee roasting, providing a comprehensive curriculum for coffee roasting professionals.

### Theoretical Foundations

#### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. In coffee roasting, this principle can be applied to optimize roasting parameters, ensuring high-quality beans.

**Core Tenets:**

1. **Homeostasis**: Maintaining optimal roasting conditions.
2. **Prediction**: Minimizing prediction errors through dynamic roast profile optimization.
3. **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity in roasting processes.

#### Active Inference

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy. In coffee roasting, this translates to:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about roasting states.
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing roasting strategies based on expected outcomes.

### Applications in Coffee Roasting

#### AI-Assisted Roasting

AI algorithms can monitor and adjust key parameters like temperature, airflow, and drum speed in real-time, improving roasting consistency and flavor.

**Example:**

* A study demonstrated the use of machine learning to control complex roasting steps with predictive adjustments, resulting in enhanced quality and efficiency.

#### Roasting Software Tools

Software tools use temperature curve modeling and rate of rise calculations to optimize roast profiles dynamically.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Temperature Curve Modeling**: Predicting temperature changes during roasting.
* **Rate of Rise Calculations**: Optimizing heating rates for optimal flavor.
