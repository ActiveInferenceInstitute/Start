1. Understand the principles of Active Inference and its application to cognitive architecture and decision-making.
2. Analyze the role of mental models and conceptual frameworks in coffee roasting.
3. Develop problem-solving strategies for adjusting roasting profiles based on sensory and chemical analysis.
4. Evaluate the impact of cognitive biases and limitations on decision-making in coffee roasting.

## Core Content

### Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making

Cognitive architectures are computational models that describe how agents (e.g., humans, robots) process information, make decisions, and behave. In the context of coffee roasting, cognitive architectures can help understand how roasters perceive, process, and respond to sensory information.

**Mental Models & Conceptual Frameworks:**

* Frameworks centered on the transformation of raw beans by heat and time.
* Emphasis on cause-effect sequences in chemical changes during roasting.
* Metaphors related to cooking and chemistry.
* Categorization by roasting levels (light, medium, dark) and flavor profiles.
* Blend of concrete sensory feedback and abstract data interpretation.

### Problem-Solving Strategies

* Analytical adjustments to roasting profiles based on sensory and chemical analysis.
* Intuitive refinements informed by experience.
* Systems thinking to anticipate crop variability and roasting impacts.
* Risk management in maintaining flavor consistency and resource use.
* Emphasis on creative approaches to develop unique blends and flavors.

### Cognitive Biases & Limitations

* Confirmation bias toward traditional roasting methods.
* Expertise leading to potential overconfidence in sensory judgment.
* Shortcuts in causal attribution for flavor changes without data.
* Resistance to adopting novel technologies.

### Collaborative Intelligence

* Team roles in production, quality, and R&D.
* Clear communication channels between roasters and supply chain partners.
* Conflict negotiation over production schedules and quality issues.
* Leadership promoting innovation adoption.
* Cross-functional collaboration for product development.

## Active Inference Theory

### Core Principles

Active Inference extends the Free Energy Principle by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

**Perceptual Inference:**

* Updating beliefs about environmental states
* Prediction error minimization
* Belief updating through variational inference

**Active Sampling:**

* Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
* Policy selection based on expected outcomes

### Process Theory

Active Inference can be understood as a process theory with the following components:

* **Perception**: Hierarchical message passing, prediction error minimization, and belief updating.
* **Action**: Motor predictions, proprioceptive inference, and action as controlled hallucination.
* **Learning**: Model parameter updating, habit formation, and structural learning of generative models.

## Applications and Domains

### Neuroscience Applications

* **Brain Function:** Explaining laminar structure and connectivity patterns.
* **Attention:** Precision-weighted prediction error processing.
* **Consciousness:** Global workspace through hierarchical inference.

### Artificial Intelligence

* **Machine Learning:** Variational autoencoders, reinforcement learning, and continual learning.
* **Robotics:** Sensorimotor control, navigation, and manipulation.
