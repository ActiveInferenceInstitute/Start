# 5. Hands-On Implementation Laboratory

## Section 5: Hands-On Implementation Laboratory

**Section Introduction:**
Welcome to the Hands-On Implementation Laboratory, where you will apply the concepts of Active Inference and Free Energy Principle to the coffee roasting industry. This section is designed to provide a comprehensive and engaging learning experience, enabling you to understand, apply, and innovate with these concepts in your professional context.

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Understand the application of Active Inference in coffee roasting.
2. Learn to implement computational skills in Python (pymdp) for coffee roasting data interfaces and visualization tools.
3. Design and conduct experiments illustrating hypothesis testing with Active Inference models.
4. Integrate inference algorithms into existing roasting software platforms.
5. Develop user-friendly interfaces for roaster operational teams.

**Computational Skills:**

### Programming Tutorials

#### Python (pymdp) Tutorials

```python
import pymdp

# Define the model
model = pymdp.models.FreeEnergyModel()

# Simulate the model
sim = pymdp.simulation.Simulation(model)

# Run the simulation
sim.run()
```

#### Roasting Data Interfaces

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('roasting_data.csv')

# Visualize the data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(data['temperature'])
plt.show()
```

#### Visualization Tools

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the temperature curve
plt.plot(data['temperature'])
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')
plt.title('Temperature Curve')
plt.show()

# Plot the rate of rise
plt.plot(data['rate_of_rise'])
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Rate of Rise')
plt.title('Rate of Rise')
plt.show()

# Plot the airflow adjustments
plt.plot(data['airflow'])
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Airflow')
plt.title('Airflow Adjustments')
plt.show()
```

### Experimental Design

#### Roasting Batch Experiments

1. Design an experiment to test the effect of different roasting profiles on coffee quality.
2. Conduct the experiment using Active Inference models.
3. Analyze the results and compare to sensory evaluation protocols.

#### Sensory Evaluation Protocols

1. Develop a sensory evaluation protocol to assess coffee quality.
2. Correlate the sensory evaluation results with the modeled predictions.

### Professional Tools Development

#### Integrating Inference Algorithms

1. Integrate Active Inference algorithms into existing roasting software platforms.
2. Design user-friendly interfaces for roaster operational teams.
3. Set up data logging and feedback systems.

#### User-Friendly Interfaces

```python
import tkinter as tk

# Create a simple GUI
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Roasting Control Interface")

# Add buttons and labels
button = tk.Button(root, text="Start Roast")
button.pack()

label = tk.Label(root, text="Temperature: 400Â°F")
label.pack()

root.mainloop()
```
