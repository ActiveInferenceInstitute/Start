### Active Inference Theory and Mathematical Framework

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) provide a unified theoretical framework for understanding biological and artificial intelligence. The FEP posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. AI extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of FEP and AI rests on variational inference and information theory. The variational free energy (F) is a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

### Applications and Domains

FEP and AI have been applied in various domains, including neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, and psychology. In coffee roasting, FEP and AI can be applied to predict roast curves, optimize roasting parameters, and improve quality control.
