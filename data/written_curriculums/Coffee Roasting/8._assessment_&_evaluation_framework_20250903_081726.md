# 8. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

## Section 8. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

### Introduction

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is a critical component of the curriculum, designed to ensure that learners have acquired the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies in applying Active Inference to coffee roasting. This framework provides a comprehensive approach to assessing learner understanding and application, including formative quizzes, practical project evaluations, peer-reviewed case studies, and a final capstone presentation.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand Assessment in Active Inference:** Explain the role of assessment and evaluation in the context of Active Inference and its applications in coffee roasting.
2. **Design Formative Assessments:** Create formative quizzes and assessments to evaluate understanding of theoretical concepts in roasting scenarios.
3. **Evaluate Roast Profiles:** Analyze and optimize roast profiles using practical project evaluations and Active Inference principles.
4. **Conduct Peer Reviews:** Perform peer-reviewed case studies and provide constructive feedback on coffee roasting applications.
5. **Present Capstone Projects:** Develop and present a capstone project integrating multi-level Active Inference applications in coffee roasting.

### Formative Quizzes

Formative quizzes are designed to assess learners' understanding of theoretical concepts contextualized in roasting scenarios. These quizzes will cover topics such as:

* **Free Energy Principle:** Understanding the basics of FEP and its application in coffee roasting.
* **Active Inference Theory:** Explaining the core principles of Active Inference and its relevance to coffee roasting.
* **Roast Profile Optimization:** Applying Active Inference to optimize roast profiles for different coffee beans.

### Practical Project Evaluations

Practical project evaluations involve assessing learners' ability to apply Active Inference principles to real-world coffee roasting scenarios. These evaluations will include:

* **Roast Profile Development:** Creating and optimizing roast profiles using Active Inference principles.
* **Sensory Evaluation:** Conducting sensory evaluations of roasted coffee and providing feedback on flavor profiles.
* **Process Optimization:** Optimizing coffee roasting processes using Active Inference and data analysis.

### Peer-Reviewed Case Studies

Peer-reviewed case studies involve learners analyzing and providing feedback on real-world coffee roasting applications. These case studies will cover topics such as:

* **Coffee Bean Selection:** Evaluating the impact of coffee bean selection on roast profile and flavor.
* **Roasting Equipment:** Analyzing the effect of roasting equipment on roast profile and flavor.
* **Quality Control:** Implementing quality control measures in coffee roasting using Active Inference.

### Final Capstone Presentation

The final capstone presentation involves learners developing and presenting a comprehensive project integrating multi-level Active Inference applications in coffee roasting. This project will demonstrate learners' ability to:

* **Apply Active Inference:** Apply Active Inference principles to a real-world coffee roasting scenario.
* **Analyze Data:** Analyze data and provide insights on coffee roasting processes.
* **Communicate Effectively:** Communicate complex ideas and results effectively to a technical audience.

### Assessment Rubric

The assessment rubric for this section will evaluate learners based on:

* **Understanding of Active Inference:** Depth of understanding of Active Inference principles and their application in coffee roasting.
* **Practical Application:** Ability to apply Active Inference principles to real-world coffee roasting scenarios.
* **Communication:** Clarity and effectiveness of communication in written and oral presentations.
* **Critical Thinking:** Ability to analyze data, evaluate evidence, and provide insights on coffee roasting processes.

### Conclusion

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework provides a comprehensive approach to assessing learner understanding and application of Active Inference in coffee roasting. By incorporating formative quizzes, practical project evaluations, peer-reviewed case studies, and a final capstone presentation, learners will be able to demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and competencies in applying Active Inference to real-world coffee roasting scenarios.
