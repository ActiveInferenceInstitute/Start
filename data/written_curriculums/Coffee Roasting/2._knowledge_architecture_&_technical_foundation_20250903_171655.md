### Core Domain Knowledge

#### Bean Chemistry, Roasting Thermodynamics, and Flavor Development

- **Bean Chemistry**: Coffee beans contain over 1,000 chemical compounds that contribute to flavor, aroma, and texture. Key compounds include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and acids.
- **Roasting Thermodynamics**: Roasting involves complex thermodynamic reactions, including the Maillard reaction, which contributes to flavor and color development.
- **Flavor Development**: Flavor profiles are influenced by bean origin, processing methods, roast level, and brewing techniques.

#### Coffee Varietals and Origin Characteristics

- **Arabica vs. Robusta**: Arabica beans are known for their mild and nuanced flavor, while Robusta beans have a bolder and more bitter taste.
- **Origin Characteristics**: Coffee beans from different regions (e.g., Ethiopia, Brazil, Colombia) have distinct flavor profiles due to variations in soil, climate, and altitude.

#### Roasting Techniques, Machine Calibration, and Packaging Impact

- **Roasting Techniques**: Roasting methods include drum roasting, air roasting, and laser roasting, each producing unique flavor profiles.
- **Machine Calibration**: Proper calibration of roasting machines ensures consistent roast levels and flavor profiles.
- **Packaging Impact**: Packaging materials and methods (e.g., bags, cans, valves) can affect flavor stability and shelf life.

#### Historical Evolution and Current Trends

- **Historical Evolution**: Coffee roasting has evolved from manual roasting to precision, data-driven processes, enabling greater control over roast profiles and flavor consistency.
- **Current Trends**: The industry focuses on sustainability, traceability, and quality consistency, with an emphasis on environmentally friendly practices and transparent supply chains.
