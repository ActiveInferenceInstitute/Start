# Active Inference Curriculum for Coffee Roasting Professionals

## Introduction

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** and **Active Inference** provide a unifying framework for understanding biological and artificial intelligence. This curriculum applies these concepts to **coffee roasting**, offering a unique perspective on the craft.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the basics of **Free Energy Principle** and **Active Inference**.
2. Apply **Active Inference** to coffee roasting processes.
3. Analyze the impact of **precision** and **surprise** on coffee roasting decisions.
4. Develop **generative models** for predicting coffee roasting outcomes.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The FEP posits that biological systems minimize **variational free energy** to maintain homeostasis.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Markov Blankets**: Statistical boundaries between internal states and external environment.
2. **Variational Density**: Internal probabilistic model of external states.
3. **Precision**: Confidence or reliability of predictions and observations.

### Active Inference

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

**Process Theory:**

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

## Applications in Coffee Roasting

### Perceptual Inference in Coffee Roasting

- **Smell and Taste Perception**: Hierarchical inference of flavor profiles.
- **Visual Cues**: Prediction error minimization in coffee bean appearance.

### Active Sampling in Coffee Roasting

- **Experimentation Strategies**: Selecting roasting parameters to minimize uncertainty.
- **Roast Profiling**: Adaptive sampling for optimal roast profiles.

### Policy Selection in Coffee Roasting

- **Roasting Strategies**: Choosing between different roast levels and profiles.
- **Blending Policies**: Selecting proportions of different beans for optimal flavor.

## Mathematical Framework

### Variational Free Energy

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

### Expected Free Energy

```mathematical
G = E_q[ln q(π) - ln p(o,π|m)] - E_q[ln p(o|π,m)]
```

## Practical Implementation
