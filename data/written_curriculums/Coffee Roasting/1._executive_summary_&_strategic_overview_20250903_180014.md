## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

### Theoretical Foundations

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
- **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

### Expected Free Energy

For Active Inference, organisms minimize **expected free energy** (G):

```mathematical
G = E_q[ln q(π) - ln p(o,π|m)] - E_q[ln p(o|π,m)]
```
