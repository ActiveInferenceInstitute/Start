# Domain Analysis

## Domain Analysis: Comprehensive Curriculum Section for Coffee Roasting Professionals

### Section Introduction

The **coffee roasting domain** is a vibrant, growing professional field embedded within the global coffee industry, which is expanding robustly due to consumer demand, innovation, and globalization. For developing an Active Inference curriculum tailored to coffee roasting professionals, a comprehensive analysis reveals the following:

### Core Active Inference Material

#### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. **Active Inference** extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Theoretical Foundations

#### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

**Core Tenets:**

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
- **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

### Mathematical Framework

#### Variational Free Energy

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

### Active Inference Theory

#### Core Principles

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
4. **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence

### Applications and Domains

#### Coffee Roasting Applications

- **Bean Selection**: Active inference for optimal bean selection based on expected flavor profiles
- **Roast Level Determination**: Minimizing expected free energy for precise roast levels
- **Flavor Profiling**: Hierarchical inference for flavor component prediction
- **Quality Control**: Precision control for consistent roast quality
