## Comprehensive Curriculum Section

### Section Name: Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making for Coffee Roasting

### Target Audience: Coffee Roasting Professionals

## Introduction

The art and science of coffee roasting involve complex cognitive processes, including cognitive architecture and decision-making. This curriculum section provides a comprehensive exploration of these topics through the lens of Active Inference, tailored specifically for coffee roasting professionals.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the principles of cognitive architecture and decision-making in coffee roasting.
2. Apply Active Inference to cognitive architecture and decision-making in coffee roasting.
3. Analyze the impact of cognitive biases and limitations on coffee roasting decisions.
4. Develop collaborative intelligence in coffee roasting teams.

## Cognitive Architecture

### Definition and Importance

Cognitive architecture refers to the structure and organization of cognitive processes, including perception, attention, memory, learning, and decision-making.

### Cognitive Architecture Frameworks

1. **Sensory Perception:** Understanding the transformation of raw beans by heat and time.
2. **Chemical Changes:** Emphasis on cause-effect sequences in chemical changes during roasting.
3. **Metaphors:** Related to cooking and chemistry.

### Decision-Making Strategies

1. **Analytical Adjustments:** Adjusting roasting profiles based on sensory and chemical analysis.
2. **Intuitive Refinements:** Informed by experience and intuition.
3. **Systems Thinking:** Anticipating crop variability and roasting impacts.

## Active Inference

### Definition and Principles

Active Inference is a theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.

### Active Inference Theory

1. **Perceptual Inference:** Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling:** Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection:** Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

## Applications and Domains

### Coffee Roasting Applications

1. **Roast Level Classification:** Light, medium, dark.
2. **Flavor Profile Analysis:** Understanding the impact of roasting on flavor.

### Collaborative Intelligence

1. **Team Roles:** Production, quality, R&D.
2. **Clear Communication Channels:** Between roasters and supply chain partners.

## Assessment and Reflection

### Assessment Strategy

1. **Knowledge Assessment:** Factual recall and conceptual understanding.
2. **Application Assessment:** Problem-solving and implementation skills.

### Reflection Tools

1. **Metacognitive Questionnaires:** Learning awareness and strategy assessment.
2. **Reflection Journals:** Structured reflection on learning and application.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive curriculum section provides coffee roasting professionals with a thorough understanding of cognitive architecture and decision-making, as well as the application of Active Inference in coffee roasting. By applying these concepts, professionals can improve their decision-making, collaboration, and overall performance in coffee roasting.
