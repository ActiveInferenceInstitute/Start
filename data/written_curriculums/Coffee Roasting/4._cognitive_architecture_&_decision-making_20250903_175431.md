# 4. Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making

## Section 4: Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making

**Section Introduction**

Welcome to Section 4: Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making, a comprehensive learning module designed to explore the intricacies of cognitive architectures and decision-making processes through the lens of Active Inference. This section is tailored specifically for coffee roasters, aiming to enhance their understanding of mental models, conceptual frameworks, problem-solving strategies, cognitive biases, and collaborative intelligence.

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Understand the transformation of raw beans by heat and time through the lens of cognitive architectures.
2. Analyze cause-effect sequences in chemical changes during roasting using metaphors related to cooking and chemistry.
3. Apply categorization by roasting levels (light, medium, dark) and flavor profiles to develop unique blends and flavors.
4. Develop analytical adjustments to roasting profiles based on sensory and chemical analysis.
5. Recognize and mitigate cognitive biases in sensory judgment and expertise.

**Section Components**

1. **Mental Models & Conceptual Frameworks:**
   - Frameworks centered on the transformation of raw beans by heat and time.
   - Emphasis on cause-effect sequences in chemical changes during roasting.

   - Systems thinking to anticipate crop variability and roasting impacts.

3. **Cognitive Biases & Limitations:**
   - Confirmation bias toward traditional roasting methods.
   - Expertise leading to potential overconfidence in sensory judgment.
   - Shortcuts in causal attribution for flavor changes without data.

4. **Collaborative Intelligence:**
   - Team roles in production, quality, and R&D.
   - Clear communication channels between roasters and supply chain partners.
   - Conflict negotiation over production schedules and quality issues.

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. **Active Inference** extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Theoretical Foundations

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
- **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

### Mathematical Framework

- **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
- **Expected Free Energy**: Organisms minimize expected free energy (G) to anticipate and adapt to their environment.

### Active Inference Theory

- **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
- **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
- **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes

### Applications and Domains

- **Neuroscience Applications**: Brain function, attention, consciousness, and psychiatric disorders
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning, robotics, and anomaly detection

### Key Researchers and Contributors

- **Karl J. Friston**: Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle
- **Andy Clark**: Philosopher of mind, extended cognition, and predictive processing
