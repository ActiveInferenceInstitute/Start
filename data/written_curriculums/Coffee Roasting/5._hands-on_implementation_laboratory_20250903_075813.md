# 5. Hands-On Implementation Laboratory
## Introduction

Welcome to the Hands-On Implementation Laboratory, specifically designed for coffee roasting professionals. This comprehensive learning module is equivalent to 3-5 hours of study and is tailored to provide substantial educational content through multiple learning modalities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this laboratory, you will be able to:

1. **Understand Computational Skills:** Implement Python programming tutorials focused on pymdp, roasting data interfaces, and visualization tools for temperature curves, rate of rise, and airflow adjustments.
2. **Design Experiments:** Conduct roasting batch experiments illustrating hypothesis testing with Active Inference models; sensory evaluation protocols correlated with modeled predictions.
3. **Develop Professional Tools:** Integrate inference algorithms into existing roasting software platforms, design user-friendly interfaces for roaster operational teams, and set up data logging and feedback systems.

## Computational Skills

### Python Programming Tutorials

In this section, we will cover Python programming skills using pymdp, a Python package for Active Inference.

#### Installing pymdp

To install pymdp, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pymdp
```

#### Basic pymdp Tutorial

Here is a basic tutorial on using pymdp for Active Inference:

```python
import numpy as np
from pymdp import ActiveInference

# Define the generative model
model = {
    'A': np.array([[0.9, 0.1], [0.1, 0.9]]),
    'B': np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.2, 0.8]]),
    'C': np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]]),
    'D': np.array([[0.5], [0.5]]),
    'pi': np.array([0.5, 0.5])
}

# Initialize the Active Inference agent
agent = ActiveInference(model)

# Perform Active Inference
agent.infer()
```

### Roasting Data Interfaces

In this section, we will cover how to interface with roasting data using Python.

#### Loading Roasting Data

Here is an example of how to load roasting data from a CSV file:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the roasting data
data = pd.read_csv('roasting_data.csv')

# Print the first few rows of the data
print(data.head())
```

### Visualization Tools

In this section, we will cover how to visualize temperature curves, rate of rise, and airflow adjustments using Python.

#### Visualizing Temperature Curves

Here is an example of how to visualize temperature curves using matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the temperature curve
plt.plot(data['temperature'])
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')
plt.title('Temperature Curve')
plt.show()
```

## Experimental Design

### Roasting Batch Experiments

In this section, we will cover how to design and conduct roasting batch experiments illustrating hypothesis testing with Active Inference models.

#### Hypothesis Testing

Here is an example of how to perform hypothesis testing using Active Inference:

```python
# Define the null and alternative hypotheses
null_hypothesis = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
alternative_hypothesis = np.array([0.7, 0.3])

# Perform hypothesis testing
agent.infer(null_hypothesis, alternative_hypothesis)
```

### Sensory Evaluation Protocols

In this section, we will cover how to design sensory evaluation protocols correlated with modeled predictions.

#### Sensory Evaluation

Here is an example of how to design a sensory evaluation protocol:

```python
# Define the sensory evaluation protocol
protocol = {
    'attributes': ['flavor', 'aroma', 'body'],
    'levels': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}

# Perform sensory evaluation
sensory_evaluation = []
for attribute in protocol['attributes']:
    for level in protocol['levels']:
        sensory_evaluation.append(attribute + ' at level ' + str(level))
```

## Professional Tools Development

### Integrating Inference Algorithms

In this section, we will cover how to integrate inference algorithms into existing roasting software platforms.

#### Integration

Here is an example of how to integrate an inference algorithm into an existing roasting software platform:

```python
# Define the inference algorithm
algorithm = {
    'type': 'Active Inference',
    'parameters': {
        'A': np.array([[0.9, 0.1], [0.1, 0.9]]),
        'B': np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.2, 0.8]])
    }
}

# Integrate the inference algorithm
roasting_software.integrate(algorithm)
```

### Designing User-Friendly Interfaces

In this section, we will cover how to design user-friendly interfaces for roaster operational teams.

#### Interface Design

Here is an example of how to design a user-friendly interface:

```python
# Define the interface
interface = {
    'layout': 'tabbed',
    'tabs': [
        {
            'name': 'Roasting',
            'fields': [
                {
                    'name': 'temperature',
                    'type': 'slider'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

# Create the interface
roasting_software.create_interface(interface)
```

### Setting Up Data Logging and Feedback Systems

In this section, we will cover how to set up data logging and feedback systems.

#### Data Logging

Here is an example of how to set up data logging:

```python
# Define the data logging system
data_logging = {
    'type': 'csv',
    'parameters': {
        'filename': 'roasting_data.csv'
    }
}

# Set up data logging
roasting_software.log_data(data_logging)
```
