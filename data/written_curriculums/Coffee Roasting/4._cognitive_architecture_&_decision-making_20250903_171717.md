4. Evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive architecture and decision-making strategies.

## Cognitive Architecture

### Mental Models and Conceptual Frameworks

Cognitive architecture refers to the structure and organization of cognitive processes, including perception, attention, memory, language, and decision-making. Mental models and conceptual frameworks are essential for understanding and analyzing cognitive architecture.

* **Markov Blankets:** Statistical boundaries that separate internal states from external environment
* **Variational Density:** Internal probabilistic model of external states
* **Precision:** Confidence or reliability of predictions and observations

### Problem-Solving Strategies

Effective problem-solving strategies are crucial for decision-making. These strategies include:

* **Analytical adjustments:** Based on sensory and chemical analysis
* **Intuitive refinements:** Informed by experience
* **Systems thinking:** Anticipating crop variability and roasting impacts

### Cognitive Biases and Limitations

Understanding cognitive biases and limitations is essential for effective decision-making. Common biases include:

* **Confirmation bias:** Toward traditional roasting methods
* **Expertise:** Leading to potential overconfidence in sensory judgment

## Active Inference Theory

### Core Principles

Active Inference extends the Free Energy Principle by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

* **Perceptual Inference:** Updating beliefs about environmental states
* **Active Sampling:** Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
* **Policy Selection:** Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes

### Process Theory

Active Inference can be understood as a process theory with components including:

* **Perception:** Hierarchical message passing and prediction error minimization
* **Action:** Motor predictions and proprioceptive inference
* **Learning:** Model parameter updating and habit formation

## Applications and Domains

### Neuroscience Applications

* **Brain Function:** Explaining laminar structure and connectivity patterns
* **Attention:** Precision-weighted prediction error processing
