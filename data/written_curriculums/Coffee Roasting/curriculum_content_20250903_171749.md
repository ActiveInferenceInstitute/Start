### Section Content

#### Theoretical Foundations

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. **Active Inference** extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

#### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

#### Practical Applications

**Coffee Roasting Case Study**:

- **Background**: Overview of the coffee roasting process and challenges.
- **Methodology**: Application of Active Inference to optimize coffee roasting.
- **Results**: Improved coffee quality and reduced energy consumption.
- **Analysis**: Discussion of results and implications for the coffee industry.

#### Assessment and Reflection

**Reflection Exercise**:

- **Reflection Questions**: Guided reflection on the learning experience.
- **Self-Assessment**: Evaluation of knowledge and application of Active Inference.
- **Peer Feedback**: Collaborative evaluation and feedback.

### Conclusion

The Active Inference Curriculum for coffee roasting professionals provides a comprehensive and engaging learning experience that prepares experts in the coffee industry to understand, apply, and innovate with Active Inference.
