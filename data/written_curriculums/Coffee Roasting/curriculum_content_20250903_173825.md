# Active Inference Curriculum for Coffee Roasting Professionals

## Introduction

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** and **Active Inference** offer a unifying framework for understanding biological and artificial systems. This curriculum applies these concepts to **coffee roasting**, providing a comprehensive and engaging learning experience for professionals in the industry.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the **Free Energy Principle** and its implications for biological systems.
2. Apply **Active Inference** to coffee roasting processes.
3. Analyze the role of **prediction** and **error minimization** in coffee roasting.
4. Develop **sensorimotor control** strategies for optimal coffee roasting.
5. Implement **Active Inference** in coffee roasting operations.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Free Energy Principle

The **Free Energy Principle** posits that biological systems minimize **variational free energy** to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.

**Core Tenets:**

1. **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states.
2. **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference.
3. **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization.

### Active Inference

**Active Inference** extends the **Free Energy Principle** by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

## Mathematical Framework

### Variational Free Energy

The mathematical foundation of **Active Inference** rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**.

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

* `F` = Variational Free Energy
* `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
* `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
* `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
