## 2.1 Introduction to Active Inference for Coffee Roasting

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand the principles of Active Inference and its relevance to coffee roasting.
2. Apply Active Inference concepts to predict roast profiles and optimize roasting processes.
3. Analyze the impact of Active Inference on coffee quality and roasting efficiency.

### 2.1.1 Conceptual Bridge-Building

Active Inference can be understood through analogies familiar to roasting professionals:

1. **Roast Curve Prediction as Active Perception:** Predicting roast curves as a form of active perception, where the roaster actively adjusts temperature and airflow to achieve desired outcomes.
2. **Real-Time Adjustments as Minimizing Prediction Errors:** Real-time temperature and airflow adjustments as minimizing prediction errors, ensuring the roast profile meets desired specifications.

### 2.1.2 Mathematical Foundations

**Free Energy as a "Measure of Surprise"**

Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a theoretical framework for understanding Active Inference. In coffee roasting, FEP can be applied to understand the "surprise" or deviation from expected roast outcomes.

**Mathematical Constructs:**

1. **Variational Free Energy:** A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
2. **Bayesian Inference:** A mathematical framework for updating beliefs about environmental states based on sensory input.

### 2.1.3 Cognitive Framework Development

**Cognitive Framework for Roasting:**

1. **Sensory Data Integration:** Integration of sensory data from various sources, such as temperature, airflow, and sound.
2. **Hierarchical Processing:** Hierarchical processing of sensory data to predict roast outcomes and adjust roasting strategies.
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Predictive modeling of roast curves and optimization of roasting processes.

### 2.1.4 Historical and Theoretical Context

**Historical Progression:**

1. **Classical Sensory Evaluation:** Traditional sensory evaluation and manual profile adjustment.
2. **Predictive Modeling:** Development of predictive models for roast curve prediction and optimization.
3. **Active Inference:** Integration of Active Inference principles for real-time roasting control.

## 2.2 Mathematical Foundations of Active Inference

### 2.2.1 Variational Free Energy

**Variational Free Energy (VFE):**

1. **Definition:** VFE is a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
2. **Mathematical Formulation:** VFE = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]

### 2.2.2 Bayesian Inference

**Bayesian Inference:**

1. **Definition:** Bayesian inference is a mathematical framework for updating beliefs about environmental states based on sensory input.
2. **Mathematical Formulation:** Bayesian inference = P(H|D) = P(D|H) \* P(H) / P(D)
