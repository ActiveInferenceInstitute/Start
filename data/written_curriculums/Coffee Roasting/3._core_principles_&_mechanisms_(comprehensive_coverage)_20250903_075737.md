### 1. Free Energy Principle (FEP) Deep Dive

**Theoretical Foundation:**

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. In coffee roasting, FEP can be applied to understand the thermodynamic and informational aspects of the roasting process.

**Thermodynamic Perspective:**

* Coffee roasting as a thermodynamic process
* Energy transformations and entropy changes

**Informational Perspective:**

* Modeling roasting as minimizing "surprise" in bean chemistry transformations and flavor profiles
* Connection to entropy and energy efficiency concepts

**Example:**

Coffee roasting can be seen as a process of minimizing free energy, where the goal is to achieve a desired flavor profile while minimizing energy expenditure.

### 2. Active Inference Process Architecture

**Process Theory:**

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy. The process architecture consists of:

1. **Perception/Inferences:** How roasting sensors and profiles inform internal probabilistic models of bean status
2. **Action/Planning:** Dynamic roasting parameter adjustments to minimize expected free energy
3. **Learning/Adaptation:** Updating roast profile models based on batch performance and sensory feedback
4. **Precision & Attention:** Weighting reliability of sensory data from temperature vs. aroma sensors
5. **Hierarchical Organization:** Multi-level control from machine settings to flavor optimization to brand consistency

**Example:**

A coffee roaster uses Active Inference to adjust roasting parameters based on real-time sensory feedback, aiming to minimize expected free energy and achieve a desired flavor profile.

### 3. Implementation Mechanisms

**Variational Message Passing:**

* Implementation of variational message passing in roasting software
* Example: Using variational message passing to update roast profile models

**Belief Propagation:**

* Belief propagation in Bayesian updates using roasting software data and AI system inputs
* Example: Using belief propagation to infer bean status from sensory data

**Bayesian Updates:**

* Bayesian updates for learning and adaptation in coffee roasting
* Example: Using Bayesian updates to update roast profile models based on batch performance
