# 2. Foundational Framework Development

## Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Foundational Framework Development

### Section Introduction

This curriculum section provides a foundational framework for understanding Active Inference and its applications in coffee roasting. Active Inference is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. The goal of this section is to develop a deep understanding of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference, and to apply these concepts to coffee roasting.

### Learning Objectives

* Understand the basic principles of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle
* Apply Active Inference to coffee roasting, including roast curve prediction and real-time temperature and airflow adjustments
* Analyze the relationship between Free Energy and surprise in flavor outcomes and machine behavior
* Develop a cognitive framework for roasting as a feedback-driven hierarchical process

### Conceptual Bridge-Building

Active Inference can be understood through analogies familiar to roasting professionals:

* Roast curve prediction as active perception
* Real-time temperature and airflow adjustments as minimizing prediction errors
* Free Energy as a "measure of surprise" in flavor outcomes and machine behavior

### Mathematical Foundations

The mathematical foundation of Active Inference rests on variational inference and information theory:

* Variational Free Energy (F) = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
* Expected Free Energy (G) = E_q[ln q(π) - ln p(o,π|m)] - E_q[ln p(o|π,m)]

### Cognitive Framework Development

Augment systems thinking around roasting as a feedback-driven hierarchical process embracing sensory, chemical, and mechanical data:

* Sensory data: temperature, airflow, and roast level
* Chemical data: flavor compounds and Maillard reaction
* Mechanical data: equipment and process control

### Historical & Theoretical Context

Trace the progression from classical sensory evaluation and manual profile adjustment to AI-driven, predictive roasting control embodying Active Inference principles:

* Classical sensory evaluation: manual profile adjustment and sensory-guided decision-making
* Predictive roasting control: machine learning and Active Inference

### Core Active Inference Material

The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference provide a comprehensive framework for understanding biological systems and their behavior:

* Free Energy Principle: a unifying theoretical framework for understanding biological systems
