### Core Content

#### 1. Theoretical Foundations

- **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: A unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.
- **Active Inference**: Extends FEP by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

#### 2. Mathematical Framework

- **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
- **Expected Free Energy**: A mathematical framework for decision-making and learning.

#### 3. Active Inference Theory

- **Core Principles**: Perceptual inference, active sampling, policy selection, and precision control.
- **Process Theory**: A process theory with components including perception, action, and learning.

#### 4. Applications and Domains

- **Neuroscience Applications**: Brain function, attention, consciousness, and psychiatric disorders.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics.

#### 5. Key Researchers and Contributors

- **Karl J. Friston**: Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle.
- **Andy Clark**: Philosopher of mind, extended cognition, and predictive processing.

#### 6. Seminal Papers and Publications

- **"The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?"** (Friston, 2010)
- **"Surfing Uncertainty: Prediction, Action, and the Embodied Mind"** (Clark, 2016)

### Practical Applications & Implementation

#### Case Studies

- **Case Study 1:** Implementing Active Inference in coffee roasting quality control.
- **Case Study 2:** Using Active Inference for sensory analysis in coffee tasting.

#### Hands-On Projects
