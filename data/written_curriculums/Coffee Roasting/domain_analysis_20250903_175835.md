**Prerequisite Knowledge:** Basic understanding of coffee roasting processes and quality control.

### Core Content

#### Theoretical Foundations

* **Free Energy Principle (FEP):** A unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.
* **Active Inference (AI):** An extension of FEP that proposes organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

#### Mathematical Framework

* **Variational Free Energy (VFE):** A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
* **Expected Free Energy (EFE):** A mathematical construct that represents the expected value of VFE under a given policy.

#### Applications in Coffee Roasting

* **Coffee Roasting as an Active Inference Process:** Coffee roasting can be viewed as an AI process, where the roaster actively engages with the coffee beans to minimize expected free energy and achieve optimal roasting quality.
* **Optimization of Roasting Parameters:** AI can be used to optimize roasting parameters, such as temperature, time, and airflow, to achieve optimal flavor and aroma profiles.

### Practical Applications and Implementation

#### Case Studies

* **Case Study 1:** Implementation of AI in a small-batch coffee roastery.
* **Case Study 2:** Use of AI in optimizing roasting parameters for a large-scale commercial coffee roastery.

#### Hands-On Projects

* **Guided Practice Project:** Implement AI in a simulated coffee roasting environment.
* **Independent Application Project:** Develop an AI-based system for optimizing coffee roasting parameters.

### Assessment and Reflection
