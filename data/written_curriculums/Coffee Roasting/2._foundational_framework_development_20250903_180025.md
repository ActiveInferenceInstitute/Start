## 2. Foundational Framework Development

### Introduction

The **Foundational Framework Development** section is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Active Inference (AI) framework and its applications in coffee roasting. This section will explore the conceptual bridge-building between AI and coffee roasting, mathematical foundations, cognitive framework development, and historical & theoretical context.

### Conceptual Bridge-Building

Active Inference can be introduced to coffee roasting professionals through analogies familiar to their field:

*   **Roast Curve Prediction as Active Perception**: Roast curve prediction can be seen as active perception, where the roaster actively engages with the roasting process to minimize prediction errors.
*   **Real-time Temperature and Airflow Adjustments as Minimizing Prediction Errors**: Real-time adjustments to temperature and airflow can be viewed as minimizing prediction errors, ensuring the roast profile aligns with desired outcomes.

### Mathematical Foundations

The mathematical foundations of AI will be presented using coffee roasting domain data:

*   **Variational Free Energy**: Variational free energy will be explained as a measure of surprise in flavor outcomes and machine behavior.
*   **Bayesian Inference**: Bayesian inference will be introduced as a framework for updating beliefs about the roasting process.
*   **Latent States**: Latent states will be discussed in the context of bean temperature curves representing hidden states.

### Cognitive Framework Development

The cognitive framework development will focus on:

*   **Systems Thinking**: Augmenting systems thinking around roasting as a feedback-driven hierarchical process.
*   **Sensory, Chemical, and Mechanical Data**: Emphasizing the importance of integrating sensory, chemical, and mechanical data in roasting.
*   **Probabilistic Modeling**: Introducing probabilistic modeling as a conceptual expansion on intuitive expertise.

### Historical & Theoretical Context

The historical and theoretical context of AI in coffee roasting will be explored:

*   **Classical Sensory Evaluation**: Tracing the progression from classical sensory evaluation and manual profile adjustment to AI-driven predictive roasting control.
*   **Key Researchers and Breakthroughs**: Highlighting key researchers and breakthroughs relevant to process control and sensory-guided decision-making.
