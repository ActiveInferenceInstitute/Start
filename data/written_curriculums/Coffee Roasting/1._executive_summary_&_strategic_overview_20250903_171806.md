## Why Active Inference for Coffee Roasting?

Active Inference offers a principled framework for predictive control, adaptive decision-making, and uncertainty management that directly addresses coffee roasting challenges such as roast consistency, quality control, and process optimization under variable input conditions (bean origin, density, processing).

## Professional Benefits:

* Enhanced roast profile consistency via predictive modeling and real-time feedback
* Improved decision-making under sensory and environmental uncertainty
* Leveraging AI/ML integration grounded in Active Inference principles to optimize roasting parameters dynamically
* Competitive advantage through innovation in sustainable and traceable sourcing practices

## Strategic Context:
Aligns with shifting industry trends integrating AI-assisted roasting systems, driving process automation and sensory data fusion, while addressing supply chain volatility and resource constraints.

## Learning Architecture & Outcomes:
Modular, approximately 50 hours total: foundational theory, domain bridge-building, computational implementation, hands-on projects, and advanced research topics. Outcomes include confident use of Active Inference concepts in roasting optimization, practical algorithmic skills, and integration with emerging AI tools.

# Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

## Theoretical Foundations

### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

**Core Tenets:**

1. **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
2. **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
3. **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
4. **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

**Process Theory:**

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
4. **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**.

## Exercise Solutions

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pymdp
```

### Step 2: Implement Active Inference Model

```python
import numpy as np
from pymdp import agent

# Define the model
model = agent.Agent()

# Define the states and observations
states = ["state1", "state2"]
observations = ["obs1", "obs2"]

# Define the prior beliefs
priors = np.array([0.5, 0.5])

# Define the likelihood
likelihood = np.array([[0.9, 0.1], [0.1, 0.9]])

# Run the Active Inference model
model.update(priors, likelihood, observations)

# Print the updated beliefs
print(model.beliefs)
```

### Step 3: Analyze Results

```python
# Print the updated beliefs
print(model.beliefs)

# Visualize the results
