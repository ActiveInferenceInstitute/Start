### Core Content

#### Theoretical Foundations

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference provide a unified framework for understanding biological and artificial systems. In coffee roasting, Active Inference can be applied to monitor and adjust key parameters like temperature, airflow, and drum speed in real-time, improving consistency and flavor outcomes.

#### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of Active Inference rests on variational inference and information theory. The variational free energy (F) is a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

#### Practical Applications

Real-world projects demonstrate machine learning applications controlling complex roasting steps with predictive adjustments. Enhanced quality, efficiency, and operational control are key benefits confirmed through AI-assisted roasting adoption.
