## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** posits that biological systems minimize **variational free energy** to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. **Active Inference** extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

### Theoretical Foundations

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states.
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference.

### Mathematical Framework

- **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations.

### Active Inference Theory

- **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
- **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.

### Applications and Domains

- **Neuroscience**: Brain function, attention, and consciousness.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning, robotics, and anomaly detection.

### Key Researchers and Contributors

- **Karl J. Friston**: Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle.
- **Andy Clark**: Philosopher of mind, extended cognition.
