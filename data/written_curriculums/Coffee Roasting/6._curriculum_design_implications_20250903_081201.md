## Theoretical Foundations

### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The FEP posits that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy**, a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

**Core Tenets:**

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states.
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference.
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization.

### Active Inference

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

**Core Principles:**

- **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
- **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
- **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

## Mathematical Framework

### Variational Free Energy

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**.

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

## Active Inference Theory

### Core Principles

Active Inference integrates perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

**Process Theory:**

- **Perception**: Hierarchical message passing and prediction error minimization.
- **Action**: Motor predictions and controlled hallucination.
- **Learning**: Model parameter updating and habit formation.

## Applications and Domains

### Neuroscience Applications

- **Brain Function**: Explaining laminar structure and connectivity patterns.
- **Attention**: Precision-weighted prediction error processing.
- **Consciousness**: Global workspace through hierarchical inference.

### Artificial Intelligence

- **Machine Learning**: Variational Autoencoders and deep generative models.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy optimization through expected utility.
