This is akin to regulating temperature homeostasis inside the roaster.\n\n```mathematical\nF = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n- `F` = Variational Free Energy\n- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)\n- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs\n- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states\n- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence\n\n## Active Inference Process Architecture\n\nActive Inference extends FEP by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy.\n\n### Perception/Inferences\n\n- How roasting sensors and profiles inform internal probabilistic models of bean status.\n\n### Action/Planning\n\n- Dynamic roasting parameter adjustments to minimize expected free energy (e.g., airflow, drum speed modifications).\n\n### Learning/Adaptation\n\n- Updating roast profile models based on batch performance and sensory feedback.\n\n### Precision & Attention\n\n- Weighting reliability of sensory data from temperature vs. aroma sensors.\n\n### Hierarchical Organization\n\n- Multi-level control from machine settings to flavor optimization to brand consistency.\n\n## Implementation Mechanisms\n\nExplore variational message passing, belief propagation, and Bayesian updates using roasting software data and AI system inputs to illustrate applied algorithmic mechanisms.\n\n### Variational Message Passing\n\nVariational message passing is a method for approximate inference in probabilistic models. It can be used to update the internal model of the roasting process based on sensory data.\n\n### Belief Propagation\n\nBelief propagation is a message-passing algorithm for performing inference in probabilistic models. It can be used to propagate information between different levels of the hierarchical model.\n\n### Bayesian Updates\n\nBayesian updates are a method for updating the internal model based on new data.
