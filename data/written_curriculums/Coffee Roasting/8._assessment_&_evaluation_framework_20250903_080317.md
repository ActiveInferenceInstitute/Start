# 8. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

## Section 8: Assessment & Evaluation Framework

### Introduction

The assessment and evaluation framework is a critical component of the curriculum, ensuring that learners can effectively apply theoretical concepts in coffee roasting scenarios. This section provides a comprehensive framework for assessing and evaluating learner progress, including formative quizzes, practical project evaluations, peer-reviewed case studies, and a final capstone presentation.

### Formative Quizzes

Formative quizzes are designed to assess learners' understanding of theoretical concepts in coffee roasting. Each quiz consists of multiple-choice questions and short-answer questions that contextualize concepts in roasting scenarios.

* **Quiz 1: Coffee Roasting Fundamentals**
	+ Topics: Coffee bean characteristics, roasting process, and equipment
	+ Question types: Multiple-choice, short-answer
* **Quiz 2: Roast Profile Optimization**
	+ Topics: Roast profile development, optimization techniques, and sensory evaluation
	+ Question types: Multiple-choice, short-answer, case study analysis
* **Quiz 3: Active Inference Applications**
	+ Topics: Active inference theory, applications in coffee roasting, and case studies
	+ Question types: Multiple-choice, short-answer, reflective essay

### Practical Project Evaluations

Practical project evaluations assess learners' ability to apply theoretical concepts in coffee roasting to real-world scenarios. Learners will complete roast profile optimization exercises and submit their projects for evaluation.

* **Roast Profile Optimization Project**
	+ Objective: Optimize a roast profile for a specific coffee bean
	+ Deliverables: Roast profile report, sensory evaluation, and reflection essay
* **Active Inference Project**
	+ Objective: Apply active inference concepts to a coffee roasting scenario
	+ Deliverables: Project report, presentation, and reflection essay

### Peer-Reviewed Case Studies

Peer-reviewed case studies provide learners with an opportunity to analyze and discuss real-world coffee roasting scenarios. Learners will analyze case studies and provide feedback to their peers.

* **Case Study 1: Coffee Roasting for a New Market**
	+ Topic: Developing a roast profile for a new coffee market
	+ Deliverables: Case study analysis, reflection essay, and peer feedback
* **Case Study 2: Active Inference in Coffee Roasting**
	+ Topic: Applying active inference to a coffee roasting scenario
	+ Deliverables: Case study analysis, reflection essay, and peer feedback

### Final Capstone Presentation

The final capstone presentation requires learners to integrate their knowledge and skills in coffee roasting and active inference to develop a comprehensive project.

* **Capstone Project**
	+ Objective: Develop a comprehensive project that integrates coffee roasting and active inference concepts
	+ Deliverables: Project report, presentation, and reflection essay

### Conclusion

This assessment and evaluation framework provides a comprehensive framework for assessing and evaluating learner progress in coffee roasting and active inference. The framework includes formative quizzes, practical project evaluations, peer-reviewed case studies, and a final capstone presentation. Learners will develop a deep understanding of coffee roasting and active inference concepts and be able to apply them in real-world scenarios.
