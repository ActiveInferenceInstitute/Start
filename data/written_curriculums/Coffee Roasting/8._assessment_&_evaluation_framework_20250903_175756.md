## Theoretical Foundations

### Assessment Frameworks

Assessment frameworks are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of coffee roasting processes. Formative assessments provide ongoing feedback, while summative assessments evaluate overall performance.

### Roast Profile Optimization

Roast profile optimization involves adjusting parameters to achieve desired flavor profiles. This includes understanding the impact of temperature, time, and airflow on the roasting process.

### Case Study Analysis

Case studies provide practical examples of Active Inference applications in coffee roasting. Learners will analyze and discuss these case studies to deepen their understanding.

### Capstone Project

The capstone project requires learners to integrate Active Inference principles in a comprehensive coffee roasting project.
