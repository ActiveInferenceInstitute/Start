### Example of Detailed Content

#### **Theoretical Foundations of Active Inference**

**Definition and Core Tenets:**
- Active Inference (AI) is a theoretical framework that integrates perception, action, and learning.
- Core tenets: 
  1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
  2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
  3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

**Mathematical Framework:**
- **Variational Free Energy (VFE)**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations.
- **Expected Free Energy (EFE)**: A measure of the expected surprise under a policy.

#### **Coffee Roasting Process and Active Inference**

**Predictive Roasting Control:**
- **Bayesian Reasoning**: Inferring roast profiles and sensory outcomes using Bayesian models.
