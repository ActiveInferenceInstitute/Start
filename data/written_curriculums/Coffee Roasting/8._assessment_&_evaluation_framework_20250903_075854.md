## 8. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

### Introduction

The assessment and evaluation framework is a critical component of the coffee roasting curriculum, designed to ensure that learners have acquired the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies to excel in their profession. This framework integrates formative quizzes, practical project evaluations, peer-reviewed case studies, and a final capstone presentation to provide a comprehensive assessment of learner progress.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand Assessment Principles**: Explain the importance of assessment and evaluation in coffee roasting.
2. **Apply Formative Quizzes**: Use quizzes to assess understanding of theoretical concepts in roasting scenarios.
3. **Evaluate Roast Profiles**: Optimize roast profiles through practical project evaluations.
4. **Analyze Case Studies**: Critically analyze peer-reviewed case studies of coffee roasting operations.
5. **Present Capstone Projects**: Integrate multi-level Active Inference applications in coffee roasting through a final capstone presentation.

### Formative Quizzes

Formative quizzes are designed to assess learners' understanding of theoretical concepts in coffee roasting. These quizzes will be contextualized in roasting scenarios to ensure practical application.

* **Quiz 1: Roasting Fundamentals** - Covers basic roasting principles, coffee bean characteristics, and roasting techniques.
* **Quiz 2: Roast Profile Optimization** - Focuses on optimizing roast profiles for different coffee beans and roast levels.
* **Quiz 3: Sensory Evaluation** - Assesses learners' ability to evaluate coffee quality using sensory methods.

### Practical Project Evaluations

Practical project evaluations are designed to assess learners' ability to apply theoretical concepts in practical coffee roasting projects.

* **Project 1: Roast Profile Development** - Learners develop and optimize a roast profile for a specific coffee bean.
* **Project 2: Roast Level Evaluation** - Learners evaluate the quality of coffee roasted to different levels.
* **Project 3: Sensory Analysis** - Learners conduct sensory analysis of coffee samples roasted using different techniques.

### Peer-Reviewed Case Studies

Peer-reviewed case studies are designed to assess learners' ability to critically analyze and apply theoretical concepts in real-world coffee roasting operations.

* **Case Study 1: Roasting Operations** - Learners analyze a case study of a coffee roasting operation and identify areas for improvement.
* **Case Study 2: Quality Control** - Learners evaluate a case study of a coffee quality control program and suggest improvements.
* **Case Study 3: Business Strategy** - Learners analyze a case study of a coffee roasting business and develop a strategic plan.

### Final Capstone Presentation

The final capstone presentation is designed to assess learners' ability to integrate multi-level Active Inference applications in coffee roasting.

* **Capstone Project:** Learners develop and present a comprehensive project that applies Active Inference principles to a coffee roasting operation.
* **Presentation:** Learners present their projects to a panel of experts and receive feedback.

### Assessment Rubric

The assessment rubric is designed to evaluate learners' performance based on the following criteria:

* **Knowledge and Understanding** (20%): Demonstrates understanding of theoretical concepts in coffee roasting.
* **Application and Analysis** (30%): Applies theoretical concepts to practical coffee roasting projects and case studies.
* **Integration and Synthesis** (20%): Integrates multi-level Active Inference applications in coffee roasting.
* **Communication and Presentation** (30%): Effectively communicates findings and recommendations through written and oral presentations.

### Conclusion

The assessment and evaluation framework is designed to provide a comprehensive and engaging learning experience for coffee roasting professionals. By integrating formative quizzes, practical project evaluations, peer-reviewed case studies, and a final capstone presentation, learners will be able to demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and competencies in coffee roasting and excel in their profession.
