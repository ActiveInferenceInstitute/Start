# 5. Hands-On Implementation Laboratory

## Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Hands-On Implementation Laboratory

### Section Introduction

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Apply Active Inference concepts to coffee roasting processes.
2. Implement programming skills using Python (pymdp) for data interfaces and visualization.
3. Design and conduct roasting experiments using Active Inference models.
4. Analyze sensory evaluation data correlated with modeled predictions.
5. Integrate inference algorithms into existing roasting software platforms.

**Estimated Time Investment:** 10 hours

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of coffee roasting, Python programming, and data analysis.

### Component 1: Computational Skills Tutorial (2 hours)

**Python Programming:**
- Introduction to pymdp for Active Inference
- Tutorials on roasting data interfaces and visualization tools

**Example Code:**
```python
import pymdp

# Define model and inference parameters
model = pymdp.models.FreeEnergyModel()
inference_params = {'precision': 1.0}

# Run inference on roasting data
inference_output = model.infer(roasting_data, inference_params)

# Visualize temperature curves and rate of rise
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(roasting_data['temperature_curve'])
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (Â°C)')
plt.title('Temperature Curve')
plt.show()
```

### Component 2: Experimental Design and Execution (3 hours)

**Roasting Batch Experiments:**
- Design experiments to test hypotheses with Active Inference models
- Conduct sensory evaluation protocols correlated with modeled predictions

**Experimental Protocol:**
1. Prepare coffee beans and roasting equipment.
2. Implement Active Inference model for real-time monitoring.
3. Conduct sensory evaluation post-roasting.

### Component 3: Professional Tools Development (3 hours)

**Integrating Inference Algorithms:**
- Instructions to integrate Active Inference into existing roasting software platforms
- Design user-friendly interfaces for roaster operational teams

**Interface Design:**
- User interface for inputting roasting parameters
- Real-time display of Active Inference outputs

### Component 4: Data Logging and Feedback Systems (2 hours)

**Setting Up Data Logging:**
- Instructions for setting up data logging and feedback systems

**Example Data Logging Code:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame to store logging data
logging_data = pd.DataFrame(columns=['time', 'temperature', 'airflow'])

# Function to log data
def log_data(time, temperature, airflow):
    logging_data.loc[len(logging_data)] = [time, temperature, airflow]

# Example usage
log_data(10, 200, 50)
```

### Assessment Opportunities

**Quiz:** Multiple-choice questions to assess understanding of Active Inference and its application in coffee roasting.

**Project:** Develop and present a comprehensive plan for implementing Active Inference in a coffee roasting setting.

**Peer Review:** Review and provide feedback on a peer's project plan.
