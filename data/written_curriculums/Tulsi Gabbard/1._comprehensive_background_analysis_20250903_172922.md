### Core Values

- Patriotism, national security, service, integrity, and professionalism dominate her messaging and career
- Strong emphasis on ending politicization and restoring trust within intelligence

### Professional Goals

- Improve national security effectiveness, streamline intelligence operations, and safeguard constitutional freedoms
- Committed to operational excellence and principled leadership

### Social/Political Perspectives

- Generally aligned with conservative and national-security focused viewpoints; emphasizes law-and-order, border security, and counterterrorism

### Risk Orientation

- Military background suggests calculated risk tolerance balanced with mission preservation
- Willing to engage in reform amid bureaucratic resistance based on public statements

### Work-Life Balance

- Less publicly documented; military and political careers suggest disciplined time management and high work commitment

## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Key Concepts

- **Markov Blankets**: Statistical boundaries that separate internal states from external environment
- **Variational Density**: Internal probabilistic model of external states
- **Precision**: Confidence or reliability of predictions and observations
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Multi-level prediction and error correction

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

## Applications and Domains

### Neuroscience Applications

#### Brain Function

- **Cortical Hierarchy**: Explaining laminar structure and connectivity patterns
- **Attention**: Precision-weighted prediction error processing
- **Consciousness**: Global workspace through hierarchical inference

#### Neuroimaging Studies

- **fMRI**: BOLD responses as prediction error signals
- **EEG/MEG**: Oscillatory dynamics and hierarchical message passing

### Artificial Intelligence

#### Machine Learning

- **Variational Autoencoders**: Deep generative models inspired by FEP
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy optimization through expected utility

### Psychology and Cognitive Science

#### Cognitive Processes

- **Perception**: Illusions and perceptual inference
- **Memory**: Reconstructive nature of recollection
