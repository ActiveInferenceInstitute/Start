- **Likely experienced both structured institutional training and informal learning on complex security and policy matters.**

### Learning Preferences

- **Professional background implies familiarity with briefings, reports, and collaborative decision-making.**
- **Possibly favors concise, high-level syntheses and applied knowledge over highly detailed theoretical studies.**

### Collaboration

- **Roles require strong teamwork and alliance-building; hence, likely comfortable with collaborative learning but may also require independent study due to the sensitive nature of work.**

### Risk Orientation

- **Military background suggests calculated risk tolerance balanced with mission preservation.**
- **Willing to engage in reform amid bureaucratic resistance based on public statements.**

### Work-Life Balance

- **Less publicly documented; military and political careers suggest disciplined time management and high work commitment.**

## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

- **The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.**
- **Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.**

### Theoretical Foundations

- **The FEP builds upon several foundational theories, including Helmholtz's unconscious inference, predictive coding, Bayesian brain hypothesis, information theory, cybernetics, and more.**

### Mathematical Framework

- **The mathematical foundation rests on variational inference and information theory, particularly through the construct of variational free energy.**

### Active Inference Theory

- **Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy.**

### Applications and Domains

- **Neuroscience applications include brain function, cortical hierarchy, attention, consciousness, and psychiatric disorders.**
- **Artificial intelligence applications include machine learning, robotics, anomaly detection, and AI safety.**

### Key Researchers and Contributors

- **Karl J. Friston, Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and others are key contributors to the development of FEP and Active Inference.**

### Seminal Papers and Publications

- **Foundational papers include Friston (2010), Friston et al. (2017), and Parr et al. (2019).**

### Educational Resources

- **Books, online courses, interactive tools, and simulation activities are available for learning FEP and Active Inference.**

### Software and Computational Tools

- **Software packages like pymdp, SPM, and DEM Toolbox are used for implementing Active Inference.**
