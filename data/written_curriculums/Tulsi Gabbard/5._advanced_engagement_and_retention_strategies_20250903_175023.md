## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

**Free Energy Principle (FEP)** is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. **Active Inference** extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**.

## Active Inference Theory

### Core Principles

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

### Applications and Domains

### Neuroscience Applications

#### Brain Function

- **Cortical Hierarchy**: Explaining laminar structure and connectivity patterns
- **Attention**: Precision-weighted prediction error processing
- **Consciousness**: Global workspace through hierarchical inference

### Artificial Intelligence

#### Machine Learning

- **Variational Autoencoders**: Deep generative models inspired by FEP
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy optimization through expected utility

## Practical Implementation

### Getting Started with Active Inference

**Step 1: Theoretical Foundation**
1. Read introductory papers (Clark, 2013; Hohwy, 2013)
2. Study mathematical foundations (Friston, 2010; Parr & Friston, 2019)  
3. Understand hierarchical predictive coding (Friston, 2008)
4. Learn Bayesian inference basics (Bishop, 2006)

### Model Development Workflow

**Design Phase:**
1. **Problem Formulation**: Define states, observations, actions
2. **Generative Model**: Specify likelihood and prior distributions  
3. **Precision Matrices**: Define confidence in predictions and observations
4. **Policy Space**: Enumerate possible action sequences

### Best Practices

**Theoretical Rigor:**
- Ground models in established mathematical frameworks
- Clearly specify assumptions and limitations  
- Connect to broader theoretical context
- Address alternative explanations
