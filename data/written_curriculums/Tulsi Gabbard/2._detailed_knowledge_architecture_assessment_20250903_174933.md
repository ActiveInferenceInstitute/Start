### **Theoretical Foundations**

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. It posits that biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference (AI) extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

### **Mathematical Framework**

The mathematical foundation of FEP and AI rests on variational inference and information theory. Key concepts include:

- **Variational Free Energy (F):** A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
- **Expected Free Energy (G):** A measure used in Active Inference to guide action selection.

### **Applications and Domains**

FEP and AI have applications in:

- **Neuroscience:** Explaining brain function, perception, and action.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Developing more efficient and adaptive machine learning algorithms.
- **Cognitive Science:** Understanding human cognition and behavior.

### **Software and Computational Tools**

- **pymdp:** A Python package for implementing Active Inference.
- **SPM:** Statistical Parametric Mapping software for neuroimaging analysis.
