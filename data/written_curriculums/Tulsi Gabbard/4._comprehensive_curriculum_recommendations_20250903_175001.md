## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive. Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

### Theoretical Foundations

- **Markov Blankets:** Statistical boundaries separating internal states from external environments.
- **Variational Free Energy:** Mathematical construct bounding surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations.

### Active Inference Theory

- **Perceptual Inference:** Updating beliefs about environmental states.
- **Active Sampling:** Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
- **Policy Selection:** Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

### Mathematical Framework

- **Variational Inference:** Internal probabilistic model of external states.
- **Expected Free Energy:** Minimization of expected surprise and cost.

### Applications and Domains

- **Neuroscience:** Explaining brain function and psychiatric disorders.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Machine learning and robotics applications.

### Key Researchers and Contributors

- **Karl J. Friston:** Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle.
- **Andy Clark:** Philosopher of mind, extended cognition.
