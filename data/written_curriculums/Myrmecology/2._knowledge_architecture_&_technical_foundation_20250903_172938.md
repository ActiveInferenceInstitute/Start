### Active Inference and Free Energy Principle

**Theoretical Foundations**

* **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence
* **Active Inference (AI)**: an extension of FEP that posits organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy

**Mathematical Framework**

* **Variational Free Energy (VFE)**: a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world
* **Expected Free Energy (EFE)**: a mathematical construct that organisms minimize to explain perception, action, and learning as unified processes

### Applications and Domains

* **Neuroscience Applications**: brain function, attention, perception, and psychiatric disorders
* **Artificial Intelligence**: machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics
* **Psychology and Cognitive Science**: cognitive processes, decision making, and emotional states

### Key Researchers and Contributors

* **Karl J. Friston**: principal architect of the Free Energy Principle
* **Andy Clark**: philosopher of mind and extended cognition
* **Jakob Hohwy**: philosophical foundations of predictive processing

### Educational Resources

* **Books and Textbooks**: "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and Karl J. Friston
* **Online Courses and Lectures**: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Scholarpedia, and MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Sciences
