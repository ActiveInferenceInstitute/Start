## Core Active Inference Material

## Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

## Theoretical Foundations

### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

* The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

## Mathematical Framework

### Variational Free Energy

* The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

## Active Inference Theory

### Core Principles

* Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
