## 2. Multi-Layered Core Content Development

### Conceptual Foundation

Active Inference (AI) is a unified framework that explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes. It posits that biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Markov Blankets:** Statistical boundaries that separate internal states from external environment
- **Variational Density:** Internal probabilistic model of external states
- **Precision:** Confidence or reliability of predictions and observations

### Mathematical Foundation

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**.

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

### Cognitive Framework Development

**Cognitive Processes:**

- **Perceptual Inference:** Updating beliefs about environmental states
- **Active Sampling:** Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
- **Policy Selection:** Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
