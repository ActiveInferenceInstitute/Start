# 7. Assessment & Evaluation Framework 

## Introduction

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is a critical component of the Active Inference curriculum, designed to ensure that learners can effectively apply the concepts and methods of Active Inference in their professional contexts. This framework outlines the strategies and tools for assessing learner understanding, application, and innovation in the domain of Active Inference.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Design Assessment Strategies**: Create comprehensive assessment plans that evaluate knowledge, application, and innovation in Active Inference.
2. **Apply Evaluation Frameworks**: Utilize established evaluation frameworks to assess the effectiveness of Active Inference implementations.
3. **Develop Reflection and Self-Assessment Skills**: Cultivate the ability to reflect on their own learning and professional practice, identifying areas for improvement.
4. **Implement Continuous Improvement**: Develop strategies for ongoing learning and professional development in Active Inference.

## Assessment and Evaluation Strategies

### Formative Assessments

- **Quizzes and Model Debugging Tasks**: Regular quizzes and tasks to assess understanding of key concepts and mathematical foundations.
- **Group Discussions and Peer Reviews**: Collaborative activities to evaluate application and critical thinking skills.

### Summative Evaluations

- **Written Exams**: Comprehensive exams focusing on theory and mathematical foundations of Active Inference.
- **Practical Project Presentations**: Evaluations of project implementations by domain and computational experts.

### Portfolio Development

- **Professional Credentialing and Academic Credit**: Development of a portfolio for professional credentialing and academic credit.

## Assessment Tools and Resources

### Quizzes and Exams

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Assessing factual recall and conceptual understanding.
- **Open-Ended Questions**: Evaluating critical thinking and application skills.

### Project Evaluations

- **Project Proposals**: Detailed proposals outlining project objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
- **Project Reports**: Comprehensive reports documenting project implementation, results, and analysis.

### Reflection and Self-Assessment

- **Reflection Journals**: Structured reflection on learning and professional practice.
- **Peer Feedback**: Collaborative feedback and evaluation.

## Implementation and Continuous Improvement

### Instructor Support
