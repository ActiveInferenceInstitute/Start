- **Communication Templates**: Use stakeholder engagement and funding proposal templates.

### Core Active Inference Material

#### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) provide a unified theoretical framework for understanding biological systems. The FEP posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. AI extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

#### Applications and Domains

- **Neuroscience**: Explain perception, action, and learning as unified processes.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Develop machine learning models inspired by FEP and AI.
- **Psychology and Cognitive Science**: Understand cognitive processes and psychiatric disorders.
