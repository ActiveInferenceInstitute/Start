# 7. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

## 7. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

### Introduction

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is a critical component of the Active Inference curriculum, designed to ensure that learners can effectively apply theoretical knowledge in practical, real-world scenarios. This framework integrates continuous formative assessments, summative evaluations, practical project presentations, and portfolio development to provide a comprehensive evaluation of learner progress and competency.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:
1. Design and implement continuous formative assessments using quizzes, model debugging tasks, and group discussions.
2. Develop and administer summative evaluations through written exams focusing on theory and mathematical foundations.
3. Evaluate practical projects through presentations to domain and computational experts.
4. Create a portfolio for professional credentialing and academic credit.

### Formative Assessments

#### Quizzes
- **Purpose**: To assess understanding of key concepts and theories.
- **Frequency**: Bi-weekly.
- **Format**: Online quizzes with multiple-choice and short-answer questions.
- **Example**: A quiz on the Free Energy Principle (FEP) might include questions on its theoretical foundations, mathematical framework, and applications in neuroscience and AI.

#### Model Debugging Tasks
- **Purpose**: To evaluate ability to troubleshoot and refine models.
- **Frequency**: Monthly.
- **Format**: Online submissions with detailed feedback.
- **Example**: Learners might be given a faulty model and asked to identify and fix errors, then submit their revised model for review.

#### Group Discussions
- **Purpose**: To assess collaboration, critical thinking, and application of concepts.
- **Frequency**: Weekly.
- **Format**: Online discussion forums or live meetings.
- **Example**: A discussion on the implications of Active Inference in clinical settings might require learners to analyze case studies and propose potential interventions.

### Summative Evaluations

#### Written Exams
- **Purpose**: To assess comprehensive understanding and application of theory and mathematical foundations.
- **Frequency**: Mid-term and final exams.
- **Format**: Online or in-person exams with theoretical and practical questions.
- **Example**: A mid-term exam might cover the basics of FEP and Active Inference, while a final exam could include more advanced applications and integration with other theories.

### Practical Project Presentations

#### Domain and Computational Experts Evaluation
- **Purpose**: To assess practical application and presentation skills.
- **Frequency**: Quarterly.
- **Format**: In-person or virtual presentations with feedback.
- **Example**: Learners might present their implementation of Active Inference in a robotics project to a panel of experts in AI and robotics.

### Portfolio Development

#### Professional Credentialing and Academic Credit
- **Purpose**: To document and showcase learner achievements and applications.
- **Frequency**: Ongoing.
- **Format**: Digital portfolio with reflective essays, project descriptions, and outcomes.
- **Example**: A learner might include a reflective essay on their experience implementing Active Inference in a clinical setting, along with project reports and feedback from supervisors.

### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Month 1**: Develop and deploy formative assessment tools (quizzes, model debugging tasks).
2. **Month 2-3**: Administer first round of summative evaluations (mid-term exams).
3. **Month 4-6**: Conduct practical project presentations and evaluations.
4. **Month 7-12**: Continuously update and refine assessments based on learner feedback and performance.

### Conclusion

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is designed to be comprehensive, flexible, and aligned with the learning objectives of the Active Inference curriculum. By integrating formative and summative assessments, practical project evaluations, and portfolio development, this framework ensures that learners are thoroughly prepared to apply Active Inference in their professional contexts.
