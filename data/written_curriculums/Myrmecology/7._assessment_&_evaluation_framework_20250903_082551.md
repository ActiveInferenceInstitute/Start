# 7. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

## 7. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

### Introduction

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is a critical component of the Active Inference curriculum, designed to ensure that learners can effectively apply theoretical knowledge in practical, professional contexts. This framework outlines a comprehensive approach to continuous formative assessments, summative evaluations, and portfolio development tailored to the needs of myrmecologists.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:
1. Design and implement continuous formative assessments.
2. Develop and administer summative evaluations.
3. Create a professional portfolio for credentialing and academic credit.

### Continuous Formative Assessments

#### Quizzes
- **Purpose**: Evaluate understanding of key concepts and theories.
- **Frequency**: Bi-weekly.
- **Format**: Online multiple-choice questions and short-answer questions.

#### Model Debugging Tasks
- **Purpose**: Assess ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.
- **Frequency**: Monthly.
- **Format**: Individual and group tasks.

#### Group Discussions
- **Purpose**: Evaluate critical thinking and collaboration skills.
- **Frequency**: Weekly.
- **Format**: Online forums and live sessions.

### Summative Evaluations

#### Written Exams
- **Purpose**: Assess mastery of theory and mathematical foundations.
- **Frequency**: Quarterly.
- **Format**: Comprehensive written exams.

#### Practical Project Presentations
- **Purpose**: Evaluate application of knowledge in real-world projects.
- **Frequency**: Bi-annually.
- **Format**: Live presentations with peer and expert feedback.

### Portfolio Development

#### Professional Credentialing
- **Purpose**: Document professional development and competency achievement.
- **Format**: Electronic portfolio with reflective practice entries.

#### Academic Credit
- **Purpose**: Align learning with academic standards for credit.
- **Format**: Structured portfolio with annotated work samples.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Initial Assessment**: Baseline knowledge and skill evaluation.
2. **Ongoing Assessments**: Regular formative assessments.
3. **Mid-Section Evaluation**: Summative assessment and feedback.
4. **Final Portfolio Review**: Comprehensive evaluation of learner progress.

### Assessment Tools and Resources

- **Learning Management System (LMS)**: For quiz administration and feedback.
- **Peer Review Templates**: For constructive feedback on projects.
- **Portfolio Guidelines**: For structured portfolio development.

### Conclusion

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is designed to support myrmecologists in achieving professional competency in Active Inference. Through a combination of formative assessments, summative evaluations, and portfolio development, learners will be well-prepared to apply theoretical knowledge in practical contexts.
