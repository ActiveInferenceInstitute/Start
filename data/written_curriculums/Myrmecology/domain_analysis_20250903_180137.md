1. **Understand the Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: Explain the core tenets of FEP and its application in biological systems.
2. **Apply Active Inference**: Describe how Active Inference extends FEP and its implications for perception, action, and learning.
3. **Analyze Myrmecological Applications**: Identify potential applications of Active Inference in myrmecology, including ant behavior, social organization, and ecological interactions.
4. **Evaluate Empirical Evidence**: Critically assess empirical studies on ant behavior through the lens of Active Inference.
5. **Design Innovative Solutions**: Develop novel research questions and experimental designs inspired by Active Inference.

### Core Active Inference Material

#### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
- **Markov Blankets**: Statistical boundaries that separate internal states from external environments.
- **Precision**: Confidence or reliability of predictions and observations.

#### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of Active Inference rests on variational inference and information theory.

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states

#### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating action as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

**Core Principles:**

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

### Applications and Domains

#### Myrmecological Applications

1. **Colony Organization**: Active Inference can explain the emergence of complex social structures in ant colonies.
2. **Foraging Behavior**: Ants' foraging strategies can be understood as minimizing expected free energy.
3. **Communication**: Chemical signals can be seen as a form of active sampling.

#### Empirical Evidence

Empirical studies have shown that ants exhibit behaviors consistent with Active Inference, such as optimizing foraging routes and adapting to environmental changes.
