## Active Inference and Free Energy Principle: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

### Executive Summary
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Theoretical Foundations
The FEP builds upon several foundational theories:

1. **Helmholtz's Unconscious Inference** (1867): Perception as unconscious probabilistic inference.
2. **Predictive Coding** (Rao & Ballard, 1999): Neural processing as prediction error minimization.
3. **Bayesian Brain Hypothesis** (Knill & Pouget, 2004): Brain as Bayesian inference machine.
4. **Information Theory** (Shannon, 1948): Mathematical framework for information processing.
5. **Cybernetics** (Wiener, 1948): Control and communication in biological systems.

### Mathematical Framework
The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

### Active Inference Theory
Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.
4. **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence.

### Applications and Domains
The FEP and Active Inference have applications in:

1. **Neuroscience**: Explaining brain function and psychiatric disorders.
2. **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning and robotics.
3. **Psychology and Cognitive Science**: Understanding perception, action, and learning.
