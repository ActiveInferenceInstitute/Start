# 7. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

## **7. Assessment & Evaluation Framework**

### **Introduction**
The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is designed to ensure that learners effectively understand and apply the concepts of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle in their professional context. This framework includes continuous formative assessments, summative evaluations, and practical project presentations.

### **Formative Assessments**
- **Quizzes:** Regular quizzes to test understanding of theoretical concepts and mathematical foundations.
- **Model Debugging Tasks:** Practical exercises to debug and refine Active Inference models.
- **Group Discussions:** Interactive sessions to discuss applications, challenges, and solutions.
- **Peer Review:** Learners review and provide feedback on each other's projects and assignments.

### **Summative Evaluations**
- **Written Exams:** Comprehensive exams focusing on theory, mathematical foundations, and practical applications.
- **Practical Projects:** Learners work on a project that demonstrates their ability to apply Active Inference in a real-world context.
- **Project Presentations:** Learners present their projects to a panel of experts, receiving feedback and evaluation.

### **Portfolio Development**
- **Professional Credentialing:** Learners develop a portfolio showcasing their understanding and application of Active Inference.
- **Academic Credit:** The portfolio serves as a basis for academic credit and professional certification.

### **Evaluation Criteria**
- **Theoretical Understanding:** Depth of knowledge about Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle.
- **Practical Application:** Ability to apply concepts in real-world scenarios.
- **Critical Thinking:** Capacity to evaluate different approaches and make informed decisions.
- **Communication Skills:** Effectiveness in presenting ideas and findings.

### **Implementation Plan**
- **Continuous Assessment:** Regular quizzes, model debugging tasks, and group discussions.
- **Mid-Term Evaluation:** Summative written exam and project milestone review.
- **Final Evaluation:** Project presentation and portfolio submission.

### **Feedback and Support**
- **Regular Feedback:** Constructive feedback on quizzes, projects, and presentations.
- **Support Sessions:** Additional support sessions for learners needing extra help.

### **Conclusion**
The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is designed to ensure learners achieve a deep understanding of Active Inference and can apply it effectively in their professional contexts. Continuous formative assessments, summative evaluations, and practical project presentations provide a comprehensive evaluation of learner competency.
