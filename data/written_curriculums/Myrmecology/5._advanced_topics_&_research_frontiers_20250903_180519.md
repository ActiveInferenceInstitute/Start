## Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Advanced Topics & Research Frontiers in Myrmecology through Active Inference

### Section Overview

This curriculum section provides an in-depth exploration of advanced topics and research frontiers in myrmecology (the study of ants) through the lens of Active Inference. Active Inference is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that explains biological systems' behavior as minimizing expected free energy. This section is designed for myrmecologists and related professionals, aiming to integrate cutting-edge developments in cellular collective behaviors, morphogenesis, and multi-scale models relevant to insect social systems.
