### Introduction to Myrmecology and Active Inference

**Myrmecology** is the scientific study of ants. It is a branch of entomology that focuses on the biology, ecology, and evolution of ants. Myrmecology is an interdisciplinary field that draws on ecology, evolution, behavior, and biodiversity.

**Active Inference** is a theoretical framework that provides a unified explanation of perception, action, and learning in biological and artificial systems. It is based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which posits that biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.

### Myrmecology and Active Inference: A Connection

Myrmecology and Active Inference are connected through the study of ant colonies as complex systems that exhibit self-organization and adaptation. The FEP and Active Inference provide a framework for understanding the behavior of ant colonies and their interactions with their environment.
