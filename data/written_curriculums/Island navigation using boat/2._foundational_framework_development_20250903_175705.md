# 2. Foundational Framework Development

## Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Foundational Framework Development

### Section Introduction

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Define Active Inference (AIF) and its core components.
2. Explain the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its implications.
3. Apply AIF concepts to navigation and maritime contexts.
4. Analyze the benefits and challenges of implementing AIF in practice.

**Estimated Time Investment:** 5 hours

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of navigation and maritime concepts.

### 1. Conceptual Bridge Building

**Conceptual Foundation:**
- Introduce AIF by analogy to navigation concepts such as route prediction, obstacle avoidance, and feedback control.
- Explain FEP through homeostasis and uncertainty reduction in maritime contexts.

**Activities:**
- Interactive simulation: Route planning with AIF.
- Group discussion: Applying FEP in maritime scenarios.

### 2. Mathematical Foundation

**Mathematical Framework:**
- Variational free energy and expected free energy explained using navigation-specific examples.
- Visual aids depicting probabilistic belief updating and policy selection.

**Exercises:**
- Calculate prediction errors and update beliefs in dynamic sea conditions.
- Simple exercises on Bayesian inference and variational calculus.

### 3. Cognitive Framework Development

**Cognitive Framework:**
- Expand systems thinking to view vessel-environment interactions as active inference cycles.
- Integrate cognitive models of decision under uncertainty with AIF mechanisms.

**Problem-Solving Modules:**
- Combine analytical charting with predictive model adaptation.
- Augment professional judgment with computational intuitions for precision management.

### 4. Historical and Theoretical Context

**Historical Context:**
