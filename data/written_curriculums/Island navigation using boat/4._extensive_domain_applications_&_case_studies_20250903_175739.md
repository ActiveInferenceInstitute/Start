### Primary Application Areas

#### Autonomous Island Approach and Docking Strategies

Active Inference can be applied to develop autonomous systems for island approach and docking. This involves:

1. **Bayesian Modeling**: Creating probabilistic models of the environment and vessel dynamics.
2. **Sensor Integration**: Combining data from various sensors (e.g., GPS, lidar, cameras) to estimate the vessel's state and environment.
3. **Predictive Control**: Using predictive models to plan and execute safe and efficient approach and docking maneuvers.

#### Adaptive Route Planning

Active Inference can be used to adapt route plans in response to changing tidal and meteorological conditions. This involves:

1. **Environmental Sensing**: Monitoring tidal and meteorological conditions using sensors and data sources.
2. **Route Optimization**: Using optimization algorithms to adapt route plans based on changing conditions.
3. **Real-time Updates**: Incorporating real-time updates into the route planning process.

#### Collision Avoidance

Active Inference can be applied to collision avoidance systems to integrate sensor uncertainty and multiple vessel coordination. This involves:

1. **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors to estimate the vessel's state and detect potential collisions.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Using predictive models to forecast potential collisions and plan avoidance maneuvers.
3. **Coordination**: Coordinating with multiple vessels to avoid collisions.

#### Risk Assessment

Active Inference can be used to design risk assessment systems that combine environmental data and navigational states. This involves:

1. **Environmental Data Integration**: Incorporating environmental data (e.g., weather, sea state) into the risk assessment process.
2. **Navigational State Estimation**: Estimating the vessel's navigational state (e.g., position, velocity) using sensor data.
3. **Risk Modeling**: Using probabilistic models to estimate risk based on environmental data and navigational states.
