# Domain Analysis

## Domain Analysis for Island Navigation Using Boats: An Active Inference Perspective

### Section Overview

This comprehensive curriculum section provides an in-depth exploration of island navigation using boats through the lens of Active Inference (AIF). AIF is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes. The section is designed to offer substantial educational content, equivalent to 3-5 hours of study, tailored for individuals involved in island navigation using boats.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand the Basics of Active Inference**: Explain the core principles of AIF, including the Free Energy Principle (FEP), and its relevance to navigation and decision-making.
2. **Apply AIF to Island Navigation**: Describe how AIF can be applied to improve navigation and safety in island environments.
3. **Analyze Scenarios Using AIF**: Use AIF to analyze and predict outcomes in various island navigation scenarios.
4. **Develop AIF-Informed Navigation Strategies**: Create navigation strategies informed by AIF principles to enhance safety and efficiency.
