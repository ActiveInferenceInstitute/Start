## Theoretical Foundation

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

**Core Tenets:**

- **Homeostasis:** Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
- **Prediction:** Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
- **Self-organization:** Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
- **Embodied cognition:** Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence
