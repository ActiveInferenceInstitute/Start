# 4. Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making

## Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making

### Section Introduction

This section provides an in-depth exploration of cognitive architecture and decision-making, tailored specifically for island navigation using a boat. The content is structured to address the unique challenges and requirements of navigating through island environments, emphasizing the development of strong spatial and temporal mental mapping, reliance on metaphors, causal reasoning, and effective decision-making strategies.

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the importance of strong spatial and temporal mental mapping in island navigation.
2. Recognize the role of metaphors in cognitive navigation.
3. Apply causal reasoning to environmental inputs and vessel responses.
4. Categorize navigational states and make decisions based on concrete, sensory-based information.
5. Blend analytical and intuitive decision-making approaches.

### Cognitive Architecture

#### Mental Models & Conceptual Frameworks

- **Strong Spatial and Temporal Mental Mapping**: Develop the ability to create detailed mental maps of routes, hazards, and environmental changes.
- **Metaphors**: Utilize metaphors such as “following the path,” “reading the sea,” or “feeling the vessel” to enhance navigation.
- **Causal Reasoning**: Understand the causal relationships between environmental inputs and vessel responses.
- **Categorization of Navigational States**: Categorize states into safe, risky, and avoid, and make decisions accordingly.
- **Preference for Concrete, Sensory-Based Decision Support**: Prefer decision support that is based on concrete, sensory information.

#### Problem-Solving Strategies

- **Blend of Analytical and Intuitive Decision-Making**: Combine analytical (charting, calculation) and intuitive (experience-based) decision-making approaches.
- **Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches**: Use both top-down (plan-driven) and bottom-up (data-driven) approaches to decision-making.
- **Systems Thinking**: Integrate multiple environmental and vessel factors into decision-making.
- **Active Risk Assessment and Uncertainty Management**: Actively assess risks and manage uncertainties through redundant cues.
- **Creativity in Emergency Scenarios**: Demonstrate creativity in emergency scenarios and route adjustments.

### Cognitive Biases & Limitations

- **Potential Overconfidence**: Be aware of the potential for overconfidence in automated systems or past experience.
- **Confirmation Bias**: Recognize the confirmation bias in interpreting uncertain sensor data.
- **Limited Situational Awareness**: Understand the limitations of situational awareness under fatigue or stressful conditions.
