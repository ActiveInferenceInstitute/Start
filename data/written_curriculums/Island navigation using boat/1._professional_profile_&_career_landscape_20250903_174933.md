## Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) provide a unified theoretical framework for understanding biological and artificial intelligence. 

- **FEP:** Biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis.
- **AI:** Extends FEP by incorporating action to minimize expected free energy.

### Applications in Island Navigation

- **Perceptual Inference:** Updating beliefs about environmental states.
- **Active Sampling:** Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
- **Policy Selection:** Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

## Practical Implementation

### Simulation and Modeling

- **Interactive simulations:** For concept exploration and testing.
- **Mathematical modeling:** Exercises with real data for prediction and validation.

### Case Studies

- **Primary Case Study:** Detailed analysis of island navigation challenges.
- **Comparative Case Studies:** Different contexts and applications.

### Reflection and Self-Assessment

- **Metacognitive questionnaires:** Learning awareness and strategy assessment.
- **Reflection journals:** Structured reflection on learning and application.

## Assessment and Evaluation

### Multi-Level Assessment

- **Knowledge assessment:** Factual recall and conceptual understanding.
- **Application assessment:** Problem-solving and implementation skills.

### Continuous Improvement

- **Feedback collection:** Multiple channels for learner input.
- **Performance analytics:** Learning progress and engagement tracking.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive curriculum section equips learners with a deep understanding of the professional profile and career landscape in island navigation using boats, integrating theoretical foundations, practical applications, and reflective practices.
