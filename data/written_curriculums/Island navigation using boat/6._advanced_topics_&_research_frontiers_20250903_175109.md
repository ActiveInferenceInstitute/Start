# 6. Advanced Topics & Research Frontiers

## Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Advanced Topics & Research Frontiers in Active Inference for Island Navigation using Boats

### Section Introduction

This comprehensive curriculum section explores cutting-edge developments and research frontiers in Active Inference (AIF) specifically tailored for island navigation using boats. AIF is a theoretical framework that extends the Free Energy Principle (FEP), providing a unified approach to understanding perception, action, and learning in biological and artificial systems.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand Multi-Scale AIF**: Apply AIF principles at vessel, fleet, and environmental levels.
2. **Implement Real-Time AIF**: Develop and deploy AIF models for autonomous boats in real-time.
3. **Navigate Collectively**: Design and manage distributed AIF systems for multi-vessel fleets.
4. **Integrate AIF with ML**: Combine AIF with machine learning for predictive weather and current modeling.
5. **Identify Research Avenues**: Explore funding opportunities and conferences relevant to maritime AIF.
