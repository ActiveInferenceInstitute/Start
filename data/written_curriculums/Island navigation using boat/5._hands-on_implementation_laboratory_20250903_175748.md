### **Core Active Inference Material:**

#### **Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge**

**Theoretical Foundations:**

- **Free Energy Principle (FEP):** A unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.
- **Active Inference (AIF):** Extends FEP by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

**Mathematical Framework:**

- **Variational Free Energy:** A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
- **Expected Free Energy:** Minimized by organisms to explain perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

**Applications and Domains:**

- **Neuroscience:** Explaining brain function, attention, and learning.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Machine learning, robotics, and autonomous systems.
- **Psychology and Cognitive Science:** Understanding perception, memory, and decision-making.

### **Practical Implementation:**

#### **Computational Skills Development:**

- **Python Tutorials:** Focusing on pymdp and navigation inference models.
- **Data Analysis:** Working with real maritime sensor datasets.
- **Visualization Techniques:** For belief states and policy outcomes.

#### **Experimental Design and Methodology:**
