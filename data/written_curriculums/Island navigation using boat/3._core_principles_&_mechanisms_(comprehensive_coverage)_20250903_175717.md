## Section Components

### 1. Free Energy Principle Deep Dive

#### Detailed Explanation of Free Energy Minimization

The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

**Core Tenets:**

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
- **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

**Key Concepts:**

- **Markov Blankets**: Statistical boundaries that separate internal states from external environment
- **Variational Density**: Internal probabilistic model of external states
- **Precision**: Confidence or reliability of predictions and observations
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Multi-level prediction and error correction

#### Thermodynamic Analogy

Maintaining vessel 'homeostasis' amid disturbances like waves and currents can be understood through a thermodynamic analogy. Just as a thermodynamic system seeks to minimize its energy state, a navigational system seeks to minimize its variational free energy.

#### Information Theory Perspective

From an information theory perspective, sensor fusion and entropy reduction play a crucial role in navigational decision-making. The system seeks to reduce uncertainty (entropy) about its environment and itself.

#### Variational Free Energy Derivation

The mathematical foundation of FEP rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

### 2. Active Inference Process Architecture

#### Perception and Inference

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy. The process involves:

- **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
- **Action Selection**: Choosing actions to minimize expected free energy
- **Policy Evaluation**: Balancing exploration (epistemic) and exploitation (pragmatic)

#### Action Selection and Planning

The system selects actions based on policy evaluation, balancing exploration and exploitation.

#### Learning and Adaptation

The system learns and adapts through model refinement from sensory feedback.

#### Precision and Attention

The system manages confidence in navigational sensor data and cues through precision and attention.
