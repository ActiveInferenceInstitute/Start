## 8. Assessment & Evaluation Framework

### Introduction

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is a critical component of the curriculum, designed to ensure that learners have acquired the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies in Active Inference (AIF) and its applications in island navigation using boats. This framework outlines the various assessment strategies, competency validation methods, and certification processes.

### Comprehensive Assessment Strategy

The assessment strategy for this curriculum includes:

1. **Frequent Formative Quizzes**: Regular quizzes to assess learners' understanding of theoretical and applied concepts.
2. **Summative Assessments**: Scenario analysis and modeling reports to evaluate learners' ability to apply AIF concepts in real-world scenarios.
3. **Practical Projects**: Peer-reviewed projects that assess learners' problem-solving and implementation skills.
4. **Capstone Presentation**: A final presentation with defense and reflective discussion to evaluate learners' mastery of AIF concepts and their application.
5. **Portfolio**: A comprehensive portfolio documenting learners' learning progression and project outcomes.

### Competency Validation

To ensure that learners have acquired the necessary competencies, the following validation methods will be employed:

1. **Knowledge Tests**: Assessments covering mathematical foundations and core AIF concepts.
2. **Application-Focused Case Studies**: Analysis of navigational decision-making in various scenarios.
3. **Implementation Challenges**: Computational modeling exercises to assess learners' ability to implement AIF concepts.
4. **Integration Scenarios**: Team-based projects that require collaboration and innovation.
5. **Original Contributions**: Learners' contributions to theoretical or practical maritime AIF knowledge.

### Certification and Recognition

Upon successful completion of the curriculum, learners will receive:

1. **Certification**: Aligned with maritime professional development standards.
2. **Continuing Education Credits**: Recognition for ongoing education and professional development.
3. **Transfer Credits**: Opportunities to transfer credits toward advanced degrees or specialized courses.
4. **Industry Endorsements**: Recognition of demonstrated expertise by industry partners.

### Core Active Inference Material

The curriculum is built on a comprehensive foundation of Active Inference material, including:

1. **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: A unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.
2. **Active Inference Theory**: An extension of FEP that explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes.
3. **Mathematical Framework**: Variational inference and information theory.
4. **Theoretical Foundations**: Historical context, key researchers, and seminal papers.

### Educational Resources

Learners will have access to a range of educational resources, including:

1. **Books and Textbooks**: Primary and supplementary reading materials.
2. **Online Courses and Lectures**: Interactive courses and video lectures.
3. **Interactive Tools and Simulations**: Educational software and simulations.
4. **Research Communities and Networks**: Opportunities to engage with research communities and networks.

### Software and Computational Tools

Learners will have access to a range of software and computational tools, including:

1. **Python Ecosystem**: pymdp, SPM Python, and other Python packages.
2. **MATLAB Ecosystem**: SPM12, DEM Toolbox, and other MATLAB toolboxes.
3. **Julia Ecosystem**: ActiveInference.jl and other Julia packages.

### Conclusion

The Assessment & Evaluation Framework is designed to ensure that learners have acquired the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies in AIF and its applications in island navigation using boats. The framework includes a comprehensive assessment strategy, competency validation methods, and certification processes. Learners will have access to a range of educational resources, software, and computational tools to support their learning journey.
