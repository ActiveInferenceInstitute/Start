### Core Active Inference Material

#### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

#### Theoretical Foundations

The FEP builds upon several foundational theories:

* **Helmholtz's Unconscious Inference** (1867): Perception as unconscious probabilistic inference
* **Predictive Coding** (Rao & Ballard, 1999): Neural processing as prediction error minimization
* **Bayesian Brain Hypothesis** (Knill & Pouget, 2004): Brain as Bayesian inference machine
* **Information Theory** (Shannon, 1948): Mathematical framework for information processing
* **Cybernetics** (Wiener, 1948): Control and communication in biological systems

#### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of Active Inference rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

* `F` = Variational Free Energy
* `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
* `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
* `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
* `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

#### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
4. **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence

### Applications and Domains
