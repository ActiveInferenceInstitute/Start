# Module 2: Accessible Mathematical Foundations with Coffee Examples

# Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Accessible Mathematical Foundations with Coffee Examples

## Section Overview

This curriculum section provides an extensive exploration of the mathematical foundations of Active Inference (AI) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), tailored specifically for coffee tasting professionals. Through a combination of theoretical explanations, practical exercises, and coffee-themed examples, learners will develop a deep understanding of probabilistic and Bayesian basics, variational free energy, and hierarchical Bayesian models.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Probabilistic and Bayesian Basics:** Understand the fundamentals of probability, Bayesian updating, and uncertainty in the context of sensory evaluation data.
2. **Variational Free Energy & Expected Free Energy:** Apply the concepts of free energy as a measure of surprise and uncertainty, using coffee sensory scoring inconsistencies and prediction of flavor profile outcomes as examples.
3. **Hierarchical Bayesian Models:** Model coffee flavor perception as hierarchical inference from green bean chemistry → roast profile → sensory attributes → quality scores.
4. **Practical Exercises:** Use simplified equations and example datasets from Q Grader acid identification tests and cupping scores to perform basic belief updating and prediction error calculations.

## 1.1 Probabilistic and Bayesian Basics

### 1.1.1 Fundamentals of Probability

Probability theory is essential for understanding uncertainty and making informed decisions. In the context of coffee tasting, probability can be used to evaluate the likelihood of certain defects or flavor profiles.

**Example:** Suppose a coffee bean has a 10% chance of being defective. If a tasting panel evaluates 100 beans, what is the expected number of defective beans?

### 1.1.2 Bayesian Updating

Bayesian updating is a method for updating probabilities based on new evidence. In coffee tasting, this can be used to refine predictions of flavor profiles or defect likelihoods.

**Example:** A coffee roaster believes a new roast has a 50% chance of being successful. After receiving feedback from a tasting panel, the roaster updates the probability to 70%. How does the roaster's confidence change?

## 1.2 Variational Free Energy & Expected Free Energy

### 1.2.1 Variational Free Energy

Variational free energy (VFE) is a measure of surprise or uncertainty. In coffee tasting, VFE can be used to evaluate the consistency of sensory scoring.

**Example:** A coffee tasting panel evaluates a coffee using a scoring system. If the panel's scores are inconsistent, the VFE would be high, indicating surprise or uncertainty.

### 1.2.2 Expected Free Energy

Expected free energy (EFE) is a measure of expected surprise or uncertainty. In coffee tasting, EFE can be used to predict flavor profile outcomes.

**Example:** A coffee roaster wants to predict the flavor profile of a new roast. Using EFE, the roaster can estimate the expected surprise or uncertainty of the flavor profile.

## 1.3 Hierarchical Bayesian Models

### 1.3.1 Modeling Coffee Flavor Perception

Hierarchical Bayesian models can be used to model coffee flavor perception as hierarchical inference from green bean chemistry → roast profile → sensory attributes → quality scores.

**Example:** A coffee roaster wants to understand how green bean chemistry affects the flavor profile of a roast. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, the roaster can model the relationships between these variables.

## 1.4 Practical Exercises

### 1.4.1 Q Grader Acid Identification Tests

Learners will use example datasets from Q Grader acid identification tests to perform basic belief updating and prediction error calculations.

**Exercise:** Evaluate the acidity of a coffee using a Q Grader test. Update your predictions based on new evidence.

### 1.4.2 Cupping Scores

Learners will use example datasets from cupping scores to perform basic belief updating and prediction error calculations.

**Exercise:** Evaluate the flavor profile of a coffee using a cupping score. Update your predictions based on new evidence.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive curriculum section provides coffee tasting professionals with a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle. Through practical exercises and coffee-themed examples, learners will develop the skills to apply these concepts in their professional context.
