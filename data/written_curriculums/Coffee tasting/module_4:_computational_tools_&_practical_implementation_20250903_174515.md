# Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Module 4 - Computational Tools & Practical Implementation

## Section Introduction

This module provides an in-depth exploration of computational tools and practical implementation strategies for Active Inference in coffee tasting. Learners will gain hands-on experience with the pymdp Python package, interactive notebooks, and various data visualization techniques. The module is designed to equip coffee professionals with the skills to apply Active Inference in their daily work, enhancing their understanding of coffee flavor profiles and quality control processes.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the basics of the pymdp Python package and its application in Active Inference.
2. Apply interactive notebooks to simulate Active Inference belief updates using coffee tasting data.
3. Implement data visualization techniques to enhance communication of probabilistic flavor profiles and quality certainty.
4. Integrate Active Inference-based decision support into cupping protocols and roaster feedback loops.

## 4.1 Software Overview

### Introduction to pymdp Python Package

The pymdp Python package is a powerful tool for implementing Active Inference. It provides an interactive and intuitive way to simulate belief updates and analyze sensory data.

### Interactive Notebooks

Interactive notebooks are used to simulate Active Inference belief updates using coffee tasting data. These notebooks allow learners to experiment with different parameters and visualize the results.

### Example Code

```python
import numpy as np
from pymdp import ActiveInference

# Define the generative model
model = {
    'obs': ['flavor', 'aroma'],
    'states': ['roast_level', 'defect_type'],
    'actions': ['roast', 'sort']
}

# Initialize the Active Inference agent
agent = ActiveInference(model)

# Simulate belief updates
beliefs = agent.update_beliefs()
```

## 4.2 Hands-on Projects

### Project 1: Modeling Sensory Calibration Updates

Learners will model sensory calibration updates after Q Grader triangulation tests using Active Inference.

### Project 2: Implementing Prediction Error Analysis

Learners will implement prediction error analysis on roasted coffee defect identification.

### Project 3: Simulating Adaptive Roasting Policy Selection

Learners will simulate adaptive roasting policy selection via expected free energy minimization.

## 4.3 Data Visualization and Analysis

### Techniques for Sensory Data Reporting

Learners will learn techniques for sensory data reporting, enhancing communication of probabilistic flavor profiles and quality certainty.

### Data Visualization

Data visualization is a crucial aspect of sensory data analysis. Learners will learn to create informative and engaging visualizations using various tools and libraries.

### Example Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the flavor profile
plt.bar(['sweet', 'sour', 'bitter'], [0.4, 0.3, 0.3])
plt.xlabel('Flavor')
plt.ylabel('Intensity')
plt.title('Flavor Profile')
plt.show()
```

## 4.4 Integration with Existing Quality Control

### Workshop on Embedding Active Inference-based Decision Support

Learners will participate in a workshop on embedding Active Inference-based decision support into cupping protocols and roaster feedback loops.

### Integration with Cupping Protocols

Active Inference can be integrated with cupping protocols to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of coffee quality control.

### Example Integration

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the cupping protocol
protocol = {
    'steps': ['evaluation', 'grading', 'commenting']
}

# Integrate Active Inference-based decision support
def integrate_active_inference(protocol):
    # Add Active Inference-based decision support to each step
    for step in protocol['steps']:
        # Implement Active Inference-based decision support
        pass

# Apply the integrated protocol
integrated_protocol = integrate_active_inference(protocol)
```

This comprehensive curriculum section provides learners with a deep understanding of computational tools and practical implementation strategies for Active Inference in coffee tasting. By completing this module, learners will be equipped with the skills to apply Active Inference in their daily work, enhancing their understanding of coffee flavor profiles and quality control processes.
