## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.

### Theoretical Foundations

The FEP builds upon several foundational theories:

1. **Helmholtz's Unconscious Inference (1867):** Perception as unconscious probabilistic inference.
2. **Predictive Coding (Rao & Ballard, 1999):** Neural processing as prediction error minimization.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

* `F` = Variational Free Energy
* `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
* `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
* `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference:** Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling:** Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.

### Applications and Domains

Active Inference has applications in:

1. **Neuroscience:** Understanding brain function and behavior.
2. **Artificial Intelligence:** Machine learning and robotics.
