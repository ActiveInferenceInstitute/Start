## Active Inference and Coffee Tasting

### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a unifying theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. In the context of coffee tasting, FEP can be applied to understand the sensory evaluation of coffee and the minimization of sensory surprise.

### Active Inference

Active Inference extends FEP by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes. In coffee tasting, Active Inference can be used to understand the active sampling of coffee and the optimization of sensory evaluation protocols.

# Module 2: Accessible Mathematical Foundations with Coffee Examples

# Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Module 2 - Accessible Mathematical Foundations with Coffee Examples

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 2: Accessible Mathematical Foundations with Coffee Examples, tailored specifically for coffee tasting professionals. This module aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of probabilistic and Bayesian basics, variational free energy, and hierarchical Bayesian models, all through the lens of Active Inference. By the end of this module, you will be equipped with the mathematical foundations necessary to enhance your coffee tasting skills and make informed decisions.

## 2.1 Probabilistic and Bayesian Basics

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the fundamentals of probability and Bayesian updating.
2. Apply probabilistic concepts to sensory evaluation data in coffee tasting.

### 2.1.1 Fundamentals of Probability

Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. In coffee tasting, probability can be used to evaluate the likelihood of certain defects or flavor profiles.

* **Example:** A coffee roaster wants to determine the likelihood of a coffee bean having a certain defect. If the roaster has tasted 100 beans and found 5 with the defect, the probability of a bean having the defect is 5/100 or 0.05.

### 2.1.2 Bayesian Updating

Bayesian updating is a statistical technique used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

* **Example:** A coffee taster wants to determine the likelihood of a coffee being of high quality based on its flavor profile. If the taster has prior knowledge that 80% of high-quality coffees have a certain flavor profile, and they taste a coffee with that profile, they can update their probability estimate using Bayesian updating.

## 2.2 Variational Free Energy & Expected Free Energy

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the concept of variational free energy and expected free energy.
2. Apply variational free energy and expected free energy to coffee sensory scoring inconsistencies and prediction of flavor profile outcomes.

### 2.2.1 Variational Free Energy

Variational free energy is a measure of the surprise or uncertainty of sensory observations under an internal model of the world.

* **Example:** A coffee taster has an internal model of what a high-quality coffee should taste like. If they taste a coffee that is very different from their internal model, the variational free energy would be high, indicating a high level of surprise or uncertainty.

### 2.2.2 Expected Free Energy

Expected free energy is a measure of the expected surprise or uncertainty of future sensory observations.

* **Example:** A coffee roaster wants to predict the flavor profile of a new coffee blend. They can use expected free energy to estimate the expected surprise or uncertainty of the flavor profile based on their internal model.

## 2.3 Hierarchical Bayesian Models

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the concept of hierarchical Bayesian models.
2. Apply hierarchical Bayesian models to coffee flavor perception from green bean chemistry → roast profile → sensory attributes → quality scores.

### 2.3.1 Hierarchical Bayesian Models

Hierarchical Bayesian models are statistical models that represent complex systems as a hierarchy of simpler models.

* **Example:** A coffee taster wants to model the relationship between green bean chemistry, roast profile, sensory attributes, and quality scores. They can use a hierarchical Bayesian model to represent this complex system as a hierarchy of simpler models.

## 2.4 Practical Exercises

### Learning Objectives

1. Apply simplified equations and example datasets to perform basic belief updating and prediction error calculations.
2. Use Q Grader acid identification tests and cupping scores to perform practical exercises.

### 2.4.1 Practical Exercise 1 - Belief Updating

* **Task:** Use a simplified equation to update your belief about the likelihood of a coffee bean having a certain defect based on new evidence.
* **Example:** A coffee roaster wants to update their belief about the likelihood of a coffee bean having a certain defect based on a new test result.

### 2.4.2 Practical Exercise 2 - Prediction Error Calculations

* **Task:** Use a Q Grader acid identification test dataset to calculate prediction errors and update your internal model.
* **Example:** A coffee taster wants to calculate the prediction error of their internal model based on a Q Grader acid identification test.

By completing these practical exercises, you will gain hands-on experience applying the mathematical foundations of Active Inference to real-world coffee tasting scenarios.

## Assessment and Reflection

## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.

### Theoretical Foundations

The FEP builds upon several foundational theories:

1. **Helmholtz's Unconscious Inference (1867):** Perception as unconscious probabilistic inference.
2. **Predictive Coding (Rao & Ballard, 1999):** Neural processing as prediction error minimization.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

* `F` = Variational Free Energy
* `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
* `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
* `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference:** Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling:** Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
