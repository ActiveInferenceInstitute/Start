# Module 4: Computational Tools & Practical Implementation

## 4.1 Software Overview

### Introduction to pymdp Python Package

The `pymdp` Python package is an interactive tool for simulating Active Inference belief updates using coffee tasting data. This package provides a simple and intuitive interface for modeling sensory calibration updates after Q Grader triangulation tests.

### Key Features of pymdp

*   **Discrete and Continuous Active Inference**: `pymdp` supports both discrete and continuous active inference models, allowing users to choose the most suitable approach for their specific application.
*   **Interactive Notebooks**: The package includes interactive notebooks that enable users to simulate Active Inference belief updates and visualize the results.
*   **Coffee Tasting Data Integration**: `pymdp` allows users to integrate coffee tasting data into their models, making it an ideal tool for coffee tasting applications.

### Installing pymdp

To install `pymdp`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pymdp
```

### Basic Usage of pymdp

Here is a basic example of how to use `pymdp` to simulate Active Inference belief updates:

```python
import numpy as np
from pymdp import ActiveInference

# Define the generative model
model = {
    'A': np.array([[0.9, 0.1], [0.1, 0.9]]),
    'B': np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.2, 0.8]]),
    'C': np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.3, 0.7]])
}

# Initialize the agent
agent = ActiveInference(model)

# Simulate Active Inference
belief_updates = agent.infer(np.array([0.5, 0.5]))

# Print the belief updates
print(belief_updates)
```
