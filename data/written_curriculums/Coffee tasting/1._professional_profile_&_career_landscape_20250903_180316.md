Sensory evaluation in coffee tasting often involves quantitative scoring and statistical analysis to ensure consistency.

```mathematical
// Example of statistical consistency calculation
double calculateMean(double[] scores) {
    double sum = 0;
    foreach (double score in scores) {
        sum += score;
    }
    return sum / scores.Length;
}
```
