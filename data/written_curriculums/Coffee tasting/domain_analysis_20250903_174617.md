# Domain Analysis

# Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Domain Analysis for Coffee Tasting Professionals

## Section Introduction

Welcome to the Domain Analysis section, tailored specifically for coffee tasting professionals. This comprehensive curriculum section is designed to explore the specialized domain of coffee tasting through the lens of Active Inference, a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental principles of Active Inference and its applications in coffee tasting.
2. Analyze the sensory evaluation, quality assessment, and characterization of coffee through established protocols.
3. Apply knowledge of sensory science, technical knowledge, and industry-specific methodologies to professional coffee tasting contexts.
4. Evaluate the relevance of Active Inference to coffee tasting and its potential for innovation and improvement.

## Core Content

### Theoretical Foundations

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference provide a framework for understanding biological systems, including the complex processes involved in coffee tasting. This section will cover:

1. **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: A unifying theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.
2. **Active Inference**: An extension of FEP that proposes organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of FEP and Active Inference rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**. Key concepts include:

1. **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
2. **Expected Free Energy**: A measure of the expected surprise or uncertainty of future sensory observations.

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

### Applications and Domains

The FEP and Active Inference have applications in various domains, including:

1. **Neuroscience**: Understanding brain function, attention, and perception.
2. **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics.
3. **Psychology and Cognitive Science**: Cognitive processes, decision making, and emotion.

### Key Researchers and Contributors

1. **Karl J. Friston**: Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle.
2. **Andy Clark**: Philosopher of mind, extended cognition, and predictive processing.
3. **Jakob Hohwy**: Philosophical foundations of predictive processing.
