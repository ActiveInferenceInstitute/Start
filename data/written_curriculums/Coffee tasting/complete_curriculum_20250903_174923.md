### Core Active Inference Material

#### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

#### Theoretical Foundations

1. **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: A unifying theoretical framework for understanding biological systems.
2. **Active Inference**: An extension of FEP that incorporates action as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

#### Mathematical Framework

1. **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
2. **Expected Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that represents the expected value of free energy.

#### Applications and Domains

1. **Neuroscience Applications**: FEP and Active Inference have been applied to understanding brain function, neurological disorders, and psychiatric conditions.
2. **Artificial Intelligence Applications**: FEP and Active Inference have been applied to machine learning, robotics, and computer vision.

### Educational Resources

1. **"Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Thomas Parr et al.**: A comprehensive textbook on Active Inference.
2. **"The Predictive Mind" by Jakob Hohwy**: A book on predictive processing and its implications for understanding the mind.
