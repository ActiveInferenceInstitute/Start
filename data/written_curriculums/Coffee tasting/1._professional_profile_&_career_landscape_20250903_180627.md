## 2. Multi-Layered Core Content Development

### Conceptual Foundation

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. **Active Inference** extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

#### Key Concepts

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
- **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence
