## Core Content

### Theoretical Foundations

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of Active Inference rests on variational inference and information theory. The variational free energy (F) is a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference theory posits that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy. This theory explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Applications and Domains

Active Inference has applications in various domains, including:

1. **Neuroscience**: Explaining brain function, attention, and consciousness.
2. **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics.
3. **Psychology and Cognitive Science**: Cognitive processes, decision-making, and emotion.

### Key Researchers and Contributors

1. **Karl J. Friston**: Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle.
2. **Andy Clark**: Philosopher of mind, extended cognition, and predictive processing.
3. **Jakob Hohwy**: Philosophical foundations of predictive processing.
