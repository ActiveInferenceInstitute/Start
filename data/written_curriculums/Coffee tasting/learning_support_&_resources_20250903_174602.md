### Core Active Inference Material

#### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

#### Theoretical Foundations

1. **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: Biological systems act to minimize variational free energy.
2. **Active Inference**: Organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

#### Mathematical Framework

1. **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
2. **Expected Free Energy**: A mathematical framework for understanding the expected outcomes of actions.

### Applications and Domains

1. **Neuroscience**: FEP and Active Inference have been applied to understanding brain function and behavior.
2. **Artificial Intelligence**: FEP and Active Inference have been applied to machine learning and robotics.

### Key Researchers and Contributors

1. **Karl J. Friston**: Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle.
2. **Andy Clark**: Philosopher of mind and cognitive science.
