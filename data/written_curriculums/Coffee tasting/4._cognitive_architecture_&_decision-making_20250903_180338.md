# 4. Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making

## Introduction

This section explores cognitive architectures and decision-making processes through the lens of Active Inference (AI). It is tailored specifically for coffee tasting professionals, aiming to enhance their understanding and application of sensory dimensions, mental models, and problem-solving strategies in their daily practice.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the principles of cognitive architectures and decision-making in coffee tasting.
2. Apply mental models and conceptual frameworks to sensory evaluation.
3. Analyze problem-solving strategies in coffee tasting.
4. Recognize cognitive biases and limitations in sensory perception.

## Cognitive Architecture

Cognitive architectures refer to the theoretical frameworks that describe how cognitive processes, such as perception, attention, memory, and decision-making, are organized and interact.

### Mental Models & Conceptual Frameworks

Mental models are internal representations of how the world works. In coffee tasting, these models help organize sensory information and guide decision-making.

* **Sensory Dimensions:** Aroma, acidity, body, and balance are key sensory dimensions used in coffee tasting.
* **Analogies with Other Sensory Domains:** Comparing coffee tasting to wine tasting can help conceptualize flavor profiles.

### Problem-Solving Strategies

Effective problem-solving in coffee tasting involves a mix of analytical and experiential intuitive decision-making.

* **Analytical Approach:** Using cupping protocols and scoring grids to evaluate coffee.
* **Experiential Approach:** Relying on past experiences and sensory memory.

### Cognitive Biases & Limitations

Cognitive biases and limitations can affect sensory perception and decision-making in coffee tasting.

* **Sensory Fatigue:** Prolonged exposure to coffee can lead to decreased sensitivity.
* **Confirmation Bias:** Expecting certain flavor profiles based on prior knowledge.

## Decision-Making

Decision-making in coffee tasting involves evaluating sensory information and making judgments about coffee quality.

### Decision-Making Frameworks

Frameworks such as SCA cupping sheets and scoring grids provide structure for evaluating coffee.

* **SCA Cupping Sheets:** Standardized forms for recording sensory evaluations.
* **Scoring Grids:** Quantitative systems for rating coffee quality.

### Collaborative Intelligence

Collaborative intelligence involves working with others to make decisions and evaluate coffee.

* **Sensory Panels:** Teams of coffee tasters evaluate coffee together.
* **Communication and Consensus-Building:** Effective communication and consensus-building are crucial.

## Active Inference

Active Inference (AI) is a theoretical framework that explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis.

* **Variational Free Energy:** A mathematical construct that bounds surprise.

### Applications of Active Inference

AI has applications in various fields, including neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.

* **Neuroscience:** Explaining brain function and behavior.
* **Cognitive Science:** Understanding perception, action, and learning.
