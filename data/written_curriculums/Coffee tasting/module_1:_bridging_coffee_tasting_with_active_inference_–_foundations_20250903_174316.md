# Module 1: Bridging Coffee Tasting with Active Inference – Foundations

# Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Module 1 - Bridging Coffee Tasting with Active Inference – Foundations

## Section Introduction

This comprehensive curriculum section, "Module 1: Bridging Coffee Tasting with Active Inference – Foundations," is designed to provide coffee tasters with a deep understanding of coffee domain foundations, sensory evaluation challenges, and the conceptual bridge to Active Inference. The section is tailored to the target audience of coffee tasters and represents substantial educational content equivalent to 3-5 hours of study.

## 1.1 Coffee Domain Foundations

### Overview of Coffee Plant Biology

The coffee plant, scientifically known as *Coffea*, is a tropical evergreen that belongs to the genus *Coffea* within the family Rubiaceae. Coffee plants are native to tropical regions of South America, East Africa, and Asia. The two main species of coffee plants are *Arabica* (70-80% of global production) and *Robusta* (20-30%).

### Post-Harvest Processing

Post-harvest processing involves several steps to transform coffee cherries into green coffee beans, including:

1. **Harvesting:** Coffee cherries are picked at the peak of ripeness.
2. **Pulping:** The outer skin and pulp of the cherry are removed.
3. **Fermentation:** The coffee beans are left to ferment, which helps to break down the mucilage.
4. **Drying:** The coffee beans are dried to a moisture level of around 11%.

### Roasting

Roasting is a critical step in the production of coffee, as it brings out the unique flavors and aromas of the coffee beans. Roast levels range from Light to Dark, with each level bringing out different characteristics.

### Cupping Practices (SCA Protocols)

The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) protocols provide a standardized framework for cupping coffee. This includes:

1. **Coffee Preparation:** Coffee is prepared using a standardized brewing method.
2. **Tasting:** Coffee is tasted and evaluated based on its sensory attributes.

### Coffee Value Assessment Framework

The Coffee Value Assessment framework provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of coffee, including:

1. **Descriptive Qualities:** Aroma, flavor, and body.
2. **Affective Qualities:** Emotional and sensory experiences.
3. **Physical Qualities:** Texture and appearance.
4. **Extrinsic Qualities:** Origin, processing, and roasting.

## 1.2 Sensory Evaluation Challenges

### Sensory Fatigue and Variability

Sensory fatigue and variability are significant challenges in coffee sensory evaluation.

### Decision-Making and Current Certification Standards

Decision-making in coffee sensory evaluation involves evaluating the quality of coffee based on its sensory attributes.

## 1.3 Conceptual Bridge to Active Inference

### Mapping Sensory Evaluation Processes

Sensory evaluation processes can be mapped to predictive coding and Bayesian inference concepts.

### Analogies with Active Inference

Analogies such as triangulation tests and acid identification can be used to illustrate Active Inference concepts.

## 1.4 Overview of Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

### Simple, Intuitive Explanation

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference provide a unified framework for understanding biological systems.

### Visual and Tangible Coffee-Related Examples

Visual and tangible coffee-related examples can be used to illustrate FEP and Active Inference concepts.
