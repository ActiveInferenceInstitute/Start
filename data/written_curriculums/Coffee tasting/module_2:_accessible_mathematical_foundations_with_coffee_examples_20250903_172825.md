# Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Module 2 - Accessible Mathematical Foundations with Coffee Examples

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 2: Accessible Mathematical Foundations with Coffee Examples, tailored specifically for coffee tasting professionals. This module aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of probabilistic and Bayesian basics, variational free energy, and hierarchical Bayesian models, all through the lens of Active Inference. By the end of this module, you will be equipped with the mathematical foundations necessary to enhance your coffee tasting skills and make informed decisions.

## 2.1 Probabilistic and Bayesian Basics

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the fundamentals of probability and Bayesian updating.
2. Apply probabilistic concepts to sensory evaluation data in coffee tasting.

### 2.1.1 Fundamentals of Probability

Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. In coffee tasting, probability can be used to evaluate the likelihood of certain defects or flavor profiles.

* **Example:** A coffee roaster wants to determine the likelihood of a coffee bean having a certain defect. If the roaster has tasted 100 beans and found 5 with the defect, the probability of a bean having the defect is 5/100 or 0.05.

### 2.1.2 Bayesian Updating

Bayesian updating is a statistical technique used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

* **Example:** A coffee taster wants to determine the likelihood of a coffee being of high quality based on its flavor profile. If the taster has prior knowledge that 80% of high-quality coffees have a certain flavor profile, and they taste a coffee with that profile, they can update their probability estimate using Bayesian updating.

## 2.2 Variational Free Energy & Expected Free Energy

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the concept of variational free energy and expected free energy.
2. Apply variational free energy and expected free energy to coffee sensory scoring inconsistencies and prediction of flavor profile outcomes.

### 2.2.1 Variational Free Energy

Variational free energy is a measure of the surprise or uncertainty of sensory observations under an internal model of the world.

* **Example:** A coffee taster has an internal model of what a high-quality coffee should taste like. If they taste a coffee that is very different from their internal model, the variational free energy would be high, indicating a high level of surprise or uncertainty.

### 2.2.2 Expected Free Energy

Expected free energy is a measure of the expected surprise or uncertainty of future sensory observations.

* **Example:** A coffee roaster wants to predict the flavor profile of a new coffee blend. They can use expected free energy to estimate the expected surprise or uncertainty of the flavor profile based on their internal model.

## 2.3 Hierarchical Bayesian Models

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the concept of hierarchical Bayesian models.
2. Apply hierarchical Bayesian models to coffee flavor perception from green bean chemistry → roast profile → sensory attributes → quality scores.

### 2.3.1 Hierarchical Bayesian Models

Hierarchical Bayesian models are statistical models that represent complex systems as a hierarchy of simpler models.

* **Example:** A coffee taster wants to model the relationship between green bean chemistry, roast profile, sensory attributes, and quality scores. They can use a hierarchical Bayesian model to represent this complex system as a hierarchy of simpler models.

## 2.4 Practical Exercises

### Learning Objectives

1. Apply simplified equations and example datasets to perform basic belief updating and prediction error calculations.
2. Use Q Grader acid identification tests and cupping scores to perform practical exercises.

### 2.4.1 Practical Exercise 1 - Belief Updating

* **Task:** Use a simplified equation to update your belief about the likelihood of a coffee bean having a certain defect based on new evidence.
* **Example:** A coffee roaster wants to update their belief about the likelihood of a coffee bean having a certain defect based on a new test result.

### 2.4.2 Practical Exercise 2 - Prediction Error Calculations

* **Task:** Use a Q Grader acid identification test dataset to calculate prediction errors and update your internal model.
* **Example:** A coffee taster wants to calculate the prediction error of their internal model based on a Q Grader acid identification test.

By completing these practical exercises, you will gain hands-on experience applying the mathematical foundations of Active Inference to real-world coffee tasting scenarios.

## Assessment and Reflection

* **Quiz:** Complete a quiz to assess your understanding of the mathematical foundations of Active Inference.
* **Reflection Journal:** Reflect on your learning experience and how you can apply the concepts to your professional practice.

## Conclusion

In this module, we have provided a comprehensive introduction to the mathematical foundations of Active Inference, including probabilistic and Bayesian basics, variational free energy, and hierarchical Bayesian models. We have also provided practical exercises and implementation guides to help you apply these concepts to your coffee tasting practice. By the end of this module, you will be equipped with the mathematical foundations necessary to enhance your coffee tasting skills and make informed decisions.
