- Identify prediction errors in sensory evaluation and implications for processing faults.
- Apply Active Inference to improve sensory evaluation and quality control.

**Detailed Case Study:**

#### Coffee Cupping Session Analysis

A recent coffee cupping session at a specialty coffee roastery revealed several prediction errors during sensory evaluation. These errors led to the identification of processing faults in certain coffee batches. 

**Background:**

- **Coffee Cupping:** A standardized method for evaluating coffee quality.
- **Active Inference:** A framework for understanding perception, action, and learning.

**Case Study:**

1. **Introduction:**
   - The coffee roastery conducts regular cupping sessions to assess coffee quality.
   - Trained cuppers evaluate coffee samples based on aroma, flavor, acidity, body, and overall impression.

2. **Prediction Errors:**
   - During a cupping session, cuppers identified unusual flavor profiles in certain batches.
   - These profiles deviated significantly from expected sensory characteristics.

3. **Active Inference Framework:**
   - The prediction errors were analyzed using Active Inference principles.
   - The framework explained how sensory failures and improvements occur.

4. **Processing Faults:**
   - The analysis revealed processing faults, such as improper fermentation or drying.

5. **Improvements:**
   - Adjustments were made to the processing protocols.
   - Subsequent cupping sessions showed improved sensory profiles.

**Conclusion:**

- Active Inference provides a powerful framework for analyzing sensory evaluation.
- Identifying and addressing prediction errors can lead to improved quality control.
