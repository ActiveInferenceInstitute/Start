## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

### Theoretical Foundations

The FEP builds upon several foundational theories:

1. **Helmholtz's Unconscious Inference (1867):** Perception as unconscious probabilistic inference.
2. **Predictive Coding (Rao & Ballard, 1999):** Neural processing as prediction error minimization.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**.

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy.

### Applications and Domains

1. **Neuroscience Applications:** Brain function, attention, and psychiatric disorders.
2. **Artificial Intelligence:** Machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics.

### Key Researchers and Contributors

1. **Karl J. Friston:** Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle.
2. **Andy Clark:** Philosopher of mind, extended cognition.

### Seminal Papers and Publications

1. **Friston, K. J. (2010).** The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory? Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 11(2), 127-138.
