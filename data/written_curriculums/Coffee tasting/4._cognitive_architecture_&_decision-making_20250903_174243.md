# 4. Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making

4. Cognitive Architecture & Decision-Making
=====================================

## Overview

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of cognitive architectures and decision-making processes through the lens of Active Inference. It is tailored specifically for coffee tasting professionals, leveraging analogies with wine tasting to enhance conceptual clarity.

## Section Objectives

1. Understand the mental models and conceptual frameworks of cognitive architectures in coffee tasting.
2. Apply problem-solving strategies and cognitive biases relevant to coffee tasting.
3. Analyze cognitive biases and limitations in coffee tasting.
4. Explore collaborative intelligence in sensory panels and decision-making.

## Mental Models & Conceptual Frameworks
- Sensory dimensions (aroma, acidity, body, balance) serve as organizing principles.
- Analogies with wine tasting for conceptual clarity.
- Cause-effect reasoning linking processing methods to sensory outcomes.
- Classification via SCA cupping sheets and scoring grids.
- Concrete sensory descriptors and abstract conceptualizations of flavor profiles.

## Problem-Solving Strategies
- Mix of analytical and experiential intuitive decision-making.
- Top-down approach framed by cupping protocols combined with bottom-up sensory data.
- Systems thinking for understanding supply chain influences.
- Risk assessment via probabilistic quality variation.
- Creativity in blending, defect troubleshooting, and developing new tasting protocols.

## Cognitive Biases & Limitations
- Sensory fatigue, confirmation bias in expected flavor profiles.
- Expertise can lead to reliance on learned categories, potentially missing novel attributes.
- Information overload during intensive tastings can reduce accuracy.
- Overconfidence in familiar samples; challenge of maintaining objectivity.

## Collaborative Intelligence
- Teams often formed for sensory panels, relying on communication and consensus-building.
- Conflict managed through standardized scoring and protocols.
- Leadership manifests in guiding tastings and setting quality benchmarks.
- Cross-functional Collaboration with production, marketing, and research departments.

## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. **Active Inference** extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.
