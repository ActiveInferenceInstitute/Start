### Active Inference in Coffee Tasting

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** and **Active Inference (AI)** provide a unifying framework for understanding biological and artificial systems. **Active Inference** can be applied to coffee tasting by:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Understanding flavor profiles through sensory data
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting samples to minimize expected free energy
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing tasting strategies based on expected outcomes

### Mathematical Framework

The **Variational Free Energy (VFE)** principle is a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
