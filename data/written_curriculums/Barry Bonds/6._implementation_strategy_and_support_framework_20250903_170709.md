# 6. Implementation Strategy and Support Framework

## Comprehensive Curriculum Section: Implementation Strategy and Support Framework

### Introduction to Active Inference

Active Inference is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. This framework explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Tailored Introduction for Barry Bonds

As a legendary athlete, Barry Bonds has a deep understanding of strategic thinking and experiential knowledge in sports. This curriculum leverages his strengths while scaffolding complex technical and mathematical foundations progressively. The focus is on applied learning, sports-related analogies, and multimodal instructional design.
