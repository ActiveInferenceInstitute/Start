## Introduction to Active Inference for Barry Bonds

### Tailored Introduction

Welcome, Barry Bonds, to the Active Inference curriculum section. As a legendary athlete, you have a deep understanding of strategic thinking and experiential knowledge in sports. This curriculum is designed to leverage your strengths while carefully scaffolding the complex technical and mathematical foundations of Active Inference.

### Active Inference in Layperson's Context

**What is Active Inference?**

Active Inference is a theoretical framework that explains how biological systems, including humans, actively engage with their environment to minimize expected uncertainty and surprise. It integrates perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Access to Software Tools

To support your learning, we will set up access to beginner-level software tools commonly used in Active Inference research. These tools will help you implement and experiment with the concepts discussed in this curriculum.

### Structured Timeline with Milestones

A tailored timeline with milestones will be created, aligning with your availability. This timeline will include:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Understanding the basics of Active Inference
2. **Mathematical Framework**: Exploring the mathematical underpinnings
3. **Practical Applications**: Implementing Active Inference in sports-related scenarios

### Mentorship Links

You will be paired with cognitive scientists experienced in translating complex concepts into practical applications. They will provide guidance and support throughout the curriculum.

### Continuous Feedback Loops

A continuous feedback loop will be established to adapt the pacing and content of the curriculum based on your feedback and progress.

### Professional Community Connections

You will be introduced to professional communities blending sports and cognitive science, providing opportunities for networking and collaboration.

## Core Active Inference Material

### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Theory

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

### Mathematical Framework

The mathematical foundation of Active Inference relies on variational inference and information theory. Key concepts include:

* **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.
* **Expected Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### Active Inference Theory

Active Inference theory includes:

* **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
* **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
* **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
* **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence
