### 6. **Core Active Inference Material**

#### **Free Energy Principle (FEP):**
- A unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.
- Posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment.

#### **Active Inference:**
- Extends FEP by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.
- Explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

### 7. **Theoretical Foundations**

#### **Markov Blankets:**
- Statistical boundaries that separate internal states from external environment.

#### **Variational Density:**
- Internal probabilistic model of external states.

#### **Precision:**
- Confidence or reliability of predictions and observations.

#### **Hierarchical Processing:**
- Multi-level prediction and error correction.

### 8. **Mathematical Framework**

#### **Variational Free Energy:**
- Mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

### 9. **Active Inference Theory**

#### **Core Principles:**
1. **Perceptual Inference:** Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling:** Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection:** Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

### 10. **Applications and Domains**
