Active Inference extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.\n\n### Mathematical Framework\n\nThe mathematical foundation of Active Inference relies on variational inference and information theory. Key concepts include:\n\n* **Variational Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.\n* **Expected Free Energy**: A mathematical construct that explains perception, action, and learning as unified processes.\n\n### Active Inference Theory\n\nActive Inference theory includes:\n\n* **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states\n* **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy\n* **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes\n* **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence\n\n## Applications and Domains\n\n### Neuroscience Applications\n\n* **Brain Function**: Explaining laminar structure and connectivity patterns\n* **Attention**: Precision-weighted prediction error processing\n* **Consciousness**: Global workspace through hierarchical inference\n\n### Artificial Intelligence\n\n* **Machine Learning**: Variational Autoencoders and deep generative models\n* **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy optimization through expected utility\n* **Robotics**: Embodied cognition in robotic systems\n\n### Psychology and Cognitive Science\n\n* **Cognitive Processes**: Perception, memory, and decision making\n* **Developmental Psychology**: Acquisition of generative models\n* **Social Cognition**: Theory of mind development\n\n## Key Researchers and Contributors\n\n* **Karl J.
