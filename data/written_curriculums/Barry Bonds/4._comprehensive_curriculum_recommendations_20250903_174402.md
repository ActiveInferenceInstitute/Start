### Module 1: Introduction to Active Inference & FEP

* **Learning Objectives:** Understand motivation, principles, sports analogies
* **Time Allocation:** 1-2 weeks
* **Prerequisites:** None
* **Assessment Methods:** Reflective essay, discussion

**Active Inference** is a theoretical framework that posits biological systems minimize expected free energy to survive and interact with their environment. **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** provides a unifying theory for perception, action, and learning.

**Core Tenets:**

* **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
* **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
* **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
* **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

**Sports Analogy:** In baseball, a batter's goal is to predict the trajectory of the ball and make an action (swing or not swing) to minimize expected free energy.

### Module 2: Neuroscience & Cognitive Concepts

* **Learning Objectives:** Understand basics of perception, learning, prediction
* **Time Allocation:** 2 weeks
* **Prerequisites:** Module 1
* **Assessment Methods:** Short quizzes, concept maps

**Perception** is an active process of inference about the environment. **Learning** involves updating internal models based on prediction errors.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Markov Blankets**: Statistical boundaries separating internal states from external environment
