- **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
- **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
- **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

### Mathematical Framework

**Variational Free Energy (FPE)**:
\[ F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)] \]

**Expected Free Energy (G)**:
\[ G = E_q[ln q(π) - ln p(o,π|m)] - E_q[ln p(o|π,m)] \]
