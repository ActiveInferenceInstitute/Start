## Educational Content
### Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge

### Theoretical Foundations

#### Free Energy Principle (FEP)
The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

**Core Tenets:**
- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states.
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference.
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization.
- **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions.

### Mathematical Framework

#### Variational Free Energy
The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:
- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence

### Active Inference Theory
Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states.
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy.
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes.

### Applications and Domains
- **Neuroscience Applications**: Brain function, attention, consciousness, psychiatric disorders.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning, reinforcement learning, robotics.
