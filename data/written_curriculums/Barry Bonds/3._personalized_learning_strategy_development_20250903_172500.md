### 1. Introduction to Personalized Learning

**Overview:** Personalized learning involves tailoring educational experiences to individual learners' needs, abilities, and interests. This approach enhances engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Learner-Centered Approach**: Focuses on the individual learner's needs and preferences.
- **Customization**: Adapting learning content, pace, and methods to fit individual learners.

**Interactive Activity:** Reflect on your current learning experiences. What aspects are personalized? What benefits or challenges do you encounter?

### 2. Active Inference Fundamentals

**Overview:** Active Inference is a theoretical framework that explains how agents (e.g., humans, AI) actively sample their environment to minimize expected surprise or free energy.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: Biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis.
- **Active Sampling**: Agents select actions to reduce uncertainty about their environment.
- **Precision**: Confidence in predictions and observations.

### 3. Designing Personalized Learning Strategies

**Overview:** Applying Active Inference to personalized learning involves designing strategies that minimize expected surprise in learning processes.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Learning as Inference**: Updating beliefs about knowledge and skills through experience.
- **Active Learning**: Selecting actions (e.g., choosing topics, asking questions) to reduce learning uncertainty.

**Guided Practice:** Design a personalized learning plan using Active Inference concepts.

### 4. Implementation and Evaluation

**Overview:** Implementing and evaluating personalized learning strategies involves continuous assessment and adjustment.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Formative Assessment**: Ongoing evaluation to inform learning adjustments.
- **Summative Assessment**: Final evaluation of learning outcomes.

**Case Study:** Example of implementing personalized learning strategies using Active Inference.
