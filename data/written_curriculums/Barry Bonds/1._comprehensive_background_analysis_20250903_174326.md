### 1. Theoretical Foundations of Active Inference in Baseball

**Active Inference Principles:**

- **Perceptual Inference:** Updating beliefs about the game state based on observations.
- **Active Sampling:** Selecting actions to minimize expected uncertainty.
- **Policy Selection:** Choosing strategies based on expected outcomes.

**Baseball Strategy Context:**

- **Game Dynamics:** Understanding the flow of the game and key decision points.
- **Player Roles:** Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of different players.
- **Opponent Analysis:** Evaluating opponent strategies and adapting accordingly.

### 2. Mathematical Framework for Baseball Strategy Analysis

**Markov Decision Processes (MDPs):**

- **States:** Game situations (e.g., score, innings, outs).
- **Actions:** Possible strategies (e.g., steal, bunt, pitch type).
- **Rewards:** Outcomes (e.g., runs scored, outs taken).

**Variational Inference:**

- **Belief Updates:** Incorporating new information into the game state model.
- **Expected Utility:** Maximizing expected outcomes under uncertainty.

### 3. Practical Applications of Active Inference in Baseball

**Case Study 1:** Analyzing a baseball game's key decision points using Active Inference.

**Case Study 2:** Optimizing batting strategies based on pitcher tendencies and game situation.

**Group Discussion:** Applying Active Inference to real-game scenarios and sharing insights.

### 4. Case Studies and Group Discussions

**Case Study Library:**

- **Primary Case Study:** Detailed analysis of a baseball game using Active Inference.
- **Comparative Case Studies:** Multiple examples of different game scenarios and strategies.

**Group Activities:**

- **Discussion Forums:** Sharing insights and strategies.
- **Peer Review:** Evaluating and providing feedback on proposed strategies.

### 5. Assessment and Reflection

**Assessment Strategy:**

- **Knowledge Assessment:** Quiz on Active Inference principles and baseball strategy.
- **Application Assessment:** Case study analysis and proposal of innovative strategies.
- **Reflection:** Journaling on learning and application experiences.

**Reflection Tools:**

- **Reflection Journal:** Structured reflection on learning and application.
- **Peer Feedback:** Collaborative evaluation and feedback.

By following this comprehensive curriculum section, learners will gain a deep understanding of Active Inference and its application to baseball strategy, enabling them to analyze and optimize game scenarios effectively.
