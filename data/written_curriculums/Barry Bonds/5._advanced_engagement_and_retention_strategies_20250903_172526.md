## **Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: Comprehensive Domain Knowledge**

### **Executive Summary**
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) provide a unifying theoretical framework for understanding biological systems, cognition, and behavior. This document offers foundational domain knowledge for FEP and AI research and curriculum development.

### **Theoretical Foundations**
- **Free Energy Principle (FEP):** A unifying framework positing that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis and survive.
- **Active Inference (AI):** An extension of FEP, suggesting that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy.

### **Mathematical Framework**
- **Variational Free Energy:** A mathematical construct bounding the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model.
- **Expected Free Energy:** A mathematical framework for understanding the implications of actions on future states.

### **Active Inference Theory**
- **Core Principles:** Perception, action, and learning as unified processes.
- **Process Theory:** A framework for understanding the processes involved in Active Inference.

### **Applications and Domains**
- **Neuroscience:** Applications in understanding brain function, psychiatric disorders, and neuroimaging.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Applications in machine learning, robotics, and anomaly detection.

### **Key Researchers and Contributors**
- **Karl J. Friston:** Principal architect of the Free Energy Principle.
- **Andy Clark:** Philosopher of mind and cognitive science.

### **Seminal Papers and Publications**
