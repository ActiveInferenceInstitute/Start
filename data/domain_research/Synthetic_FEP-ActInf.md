**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Foundational domain knowledge for Free Energy Principle and Active Inference research and curriculum development

---

## Executive Summary

The **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** is a unifying theoretical framework in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence that posits biological systems minimize a quantity called "free energy" to maintain homeostasis and survive in their environment. **Active Inference** extends this framework by proposing that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize expected free energy, thereby explaining perception, action, and learning as unified processes.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The Free Energy Principle proposes that biological systems act to minimize **variational free energy** - a mathematical construct that bounds the surprise (negative log-probability) of sensory observations under the system's internal model of the world.

**Core Tenets:**

- **Homeostasis**: Systems maintain their existence by staying within expected states
- **Prediction**: Systems minimize prediction errors through hierarchical inference
- **Self-organization**: Emergent complexity arises from free energy minimization
- **Embodied cognition**: Cognition is grounded in sensorimotor interactions

**Key Concepts:**

- **Markov Blankets**: Statistical boundaries that separate internal states from external environment
- **Variational Density**: Internal probabilistic model of external states
- **Precision**: Confidence or reliability of predictions and observations
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Multi-level prediction and error correction

### Historical Context

The FEP builds upon several foundational theories:

- **Helmholtz's Unconscious Inference** (1867): Perception as unconscious probabilistic inference
- **Predictive Coding** (Rao & Ballard, 1999): Neural processing as prediction error minimization
- **Bayesian Brain Hypothesis** (Knill & Pouget, 2004): Brain as Bayesian inference machine
- **Information Theory** (Shannon, 1948): Mathematical framework for information processing
- **Cybernetics** (Wiener, 1948): Control and communication in biological systems

## Mathematical Framework

### Variational Free Energy

The mathematical foundation rests on **variational inference** and **information theory**:

```mathematical
F = DKL[q(x)||p(x|m)] + DKL[q(x)||p(x,y|m)]
```

Where:

- `F` = Variational Free Energy
- `q(x)` = Recognition density (internal model)
- `p(x|m)` = Prior beliefs
- `p(x,y|m)` = Joint density of hidden and observed states
- `DKL` = Kullback-Leibler divergence


### Expected Free Energy

For Active Inference, organisms minimize **expected free energy** (G):

```mathematical
G = E_q[ln q(π) - ln p(o,π|m)] - E_q[ln p(o|π,m)]
```

Components:

- **Epistemic value**: Information gain (exploration)
- **Pragmatic value**: Prior preference satisfaction (exploitation)

### Implementation Mathematics

**Key mathematical constructs:**

- **Precision matrices**: Weighting of prediction errors
- **Message passing**: Belief propagation in hierarchical models
- **Gradient descent**: Optimization of free energy functionals
- **Stochastic differential equations**: Dynamics of belief updating

## Active Inference Theory

### Core Principles

Active Inference extends FEP by incorporating **action** as a means of minimizing expected free energy:

1. **Perceptual Inference**: Updating beliefs about environmental states
2. **Active Sampling**: Selecting actions to minimize expected free energy
3. **Policy Selection**: Choosing behavioral strategies based on expected outcomes
4. **Precision Control**: Modulating attention and action confidence


### Process Theory

Active Inference can be understood as a **process theory** with the following components:

**Perception**:

- Hierarchical message passing
- Prediction error minimization
- Belief updating through variational inference

**Action**:

- Motor predictions and proprioceptive inference
- Action as controlled hallucination
- Policy optimization through expected free energy minimization

**Learning**:

- Model parameter updating
- Habit formation through repeated inference
- Structural learning of generative models

### Computational Architecture

**Hierarchical Structure:**

- **Higher levels**: Abstract, slow-changing representations
- **Lower levels**: Concrete, fast-changing sensorimotor representations
- **Lateral connections**: Context-dependent processing
- **Top-down predictions**: Prior expectations and predictions
- **Bottom-up signals**: Prediction errors and sensory input
