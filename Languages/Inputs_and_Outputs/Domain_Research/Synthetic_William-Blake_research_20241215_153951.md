## Curriculum Content

### Domain-Specific Introduction (2 pages)

#### Welcome Message
Welcome, domain experts in William Blake and Romantic literature This introduction aims to bridge the gap between your existing knowledge and the principles of Active Inference, leveraging the Free Energy Principle to enhance your understanding and application of Blake's work.

#### Relevance of Active Inference to the Domain
Active Inference, rooted in the Free Energy Principle, offers a systematic approach to understanding complex symbolic representations. This framework can be particularly relevant in analyzing Blake's illuminated books, where text and images intertwine to convey deeper meanings. By applying Active Inference, you can better interpret the dynamic interactions between visual and textual elements in his works.

#### Value Proposition and Potential Applications
The Free Energy Principle provides a unified theory for understanding perception, learning, and decision-making. This principle can be applied to literary analysis by generating hypotheses about themes and symbolism in Blake's poetry and prose. It also enhances artistic interpretation by considering the artist's intentions and the cultural context. Integrating Active Inference techniques into educational pedagogy can make learning more engaging and effective for students.

#### Connection to Existing Domain Knowledge
Your expertise in literary analysis, historical contextualization, and symbolic representation can be leveraged to apply Active Inference. For instance, close reading techniques can be integrated with predictive coding to analyze how Blake's texts generate and update internal models of the world. Historical contextualization can help understand how Blake's work reflects his internal models of society and culture.

#### Overview of Learning Journey
This curriculum will guide you through the conceptual foundations of Active Inference, its technical framework, practical applications, and advanced topics. You will learn how to integrate Active Inference with your existing knowledge of literary analysis and historical context. The journey will include interactive examples, case studies from the domain, and practical exercises to ensure a deep understanding.

#### Success Stories and Examples
Applying Active Inference in literary analysis can lead to new insights into Blake's work. For example, analyzing "The Tyger" using predictive coding can reveal how Blake's internal models of creation and destruction are reflected in the poem's structure and imagery. Similarly, integrating Active Inference with historical contextualization can provide a richer understanding of how Blake's work reflects the cultural and social norms of his time.

### Conceptual Foundations (3 pages)

#### Core Active Inference Concepts Using Domain Analogies
1. **Contextual Understanding**: Both Active Inference and literary analysis require understanding the context in which information is presented or generated. For instance, analyzing Blake's illuminated books involves understanding both the historical context and the internal models he used to create them.
2. **Symbolic Representation**: Both involve symbolic representations (text in literature, images in art) that need to be interpreted. In Blake's work, symbols like the serpent and the tree of life are central to his internal models of creation and redemption.
3. **Dynamic Interactions**: Both involve dynamic interactions between different elements (characters in a story, colors in an image). For example, the dynamic interaction between text and image in Blake's illuminated books creates a rich symbolic landscape.

#### Mathematical Principles with Domain-Relevant Examples
1. **Bayesian Inference**: The process of Active Inference can be seen as a form of Bayesian inference, where prior knowledge is updated based on new data. In literary analysis, this means updating your understanding of Blake's themes and symbolism as you read through his works.
2. **Cognitive Architectures**: Both involve complex cognitive architectures that integrate multiple sources of information. For instance, analyzing Blake's poetry involves integrating knowledge of literary devices, historical context, and philosophical influences.

#### Practical Applications in Domain Context
