### Conceptual Foundations (3 pages)

#### Core Active Inference Concepts Using Domain Analogies
1. **Variational Free Energy**:
   - **Domain Analogy**: Think of variational free energy as the discomfort felt when encountering unexpected sensory input, similar to how indigenous communities might feel when their traditional practices are disrupted by environmental changes.
   - **Mathematical Principle**: Variational free energy is a measure of the difference between an organism's internal model of the world and the actual state of the world, serving as a proxy for surprise. This can be mathematically expressed as the sum of accuracy (expected log-likelihood) and complexity (KL divergence between posterior and prior beliefs).

2. **Generative Models**:
   - **Domain Analogy**: Generative models are like the cognitive maps indigenous communities use to navigate their environments. These maps predict complex ecological scenarios based on simpler features.
   - **Mathematical Principle**: Generative models allow for counterfactual reasoning and mental simulation, crucial for planning and decision-making. They are hierarchical, with higher levels encoding more abstract or general information.

3. **Predictive Coding**:
   - **Domain Analogy**: Predictive coding is like the process of storytelling in indigenous cultures, where predictions about future events are made based on past experiences. These predictions are updated based on new information, similar to how stories evolve over time.
   - **Mathematical Principle**: Prediction errors in predictive coding represent the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs, driving both perception and learning. Temporal aspects play a crucial role in predictive coding, with the brain maintaining predictions across multiple timescales.

#### Practical Applications in Domain Context
