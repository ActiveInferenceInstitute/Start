The Free Energy Principle proposes that all adaptive systems minimize their variational free energy to maintain their structural and functional integrity. This principle is particularly relevant in neuroscience because it explains how the brain processes perceptual information, learns about the environment, and selects actions to minimize uncertainty.\n\n#### Value Proposition and Potential Applications\nThe value proposition of Active Inference lies in its ability to provide a unified theory for understanding perception, action, and learning.
