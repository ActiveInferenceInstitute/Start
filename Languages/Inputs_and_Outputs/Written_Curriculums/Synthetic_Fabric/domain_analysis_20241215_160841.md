## 5. Integrating Active Inference into Textile Production

### Predictive Maintenance

Active inference can be used to predict fabric degradation or machine failures in textile production. This involves maintaining probabilistic beliefs about the state of fabrics and machinery, and selecting actions that reduce uncertainty about critical variables. For example, an autonomous textile inspection system could use active inference to predict when a fabric is likely to degrade, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime[5].

```python
# Example of predictive maintenance using Active Inference
import numpy as np

# Define the state space (fabric condition)
states = np.array([0, 1, 2])  # Healthy, Degraded, Failed

# Define the transition model (probability of moving from one state to another)
transition_model = np.array([[0.9, 0.1, 0],
                             [0.3, 0.7, 0],
                             [0, 0, 1]])

# Define the observation model (probability of observing a certain condition given the true state)
observation_model = np.array([[0.8, 0.2, 0],
                              [0.4, 0.6, 0],
                              [0, 0, 1]])

# Initialize the belief state (prior distribution over states)
belief_state = np.array([0.5, 0.3, 0.2])

# Perform active inference to update the belief state based on observations
def update_belief(observation):
    # Compute the likelihood of the observation given each state
    likelihoods = observation_model[:, observation]
    
    # Update the belief state using Bayes' rule
    new_belief_state = np.multiply(transition_model, likelihoods)
    new_belief_state /= np.sum(new_belief_state)
    
    return new_belief_state

# Simulate observations over time
for t in range(10):
    observation = np.random.choice(states)
    belief_state = update_belief(observation)

print("Predicted fabric condition:", np.argmax(belief_state))
```

### Quality Control

Active inference can also be applied to detect anomalies in fabric quality during production. This involves maintaining probabilistic beliefs about fabric quality and selecting actions that reduce uncertainty about critical variables. For example, a quality control system could use active inference to detect defects in real-time, allowing for immediate corrective action[5].

```python
# Example of quality control using Active Inference
import numpy as np

# Define the state space (fabric quality)
states = np.array([0, 1])  # Defect, No Defect

# Define the transition model (probability of moving from one state to another)
transition_model = np.array([[0.9, 0.1],
                             [0.3, 0.7]])

# Define the observation model (probability of observing a certain condition given the true state)
observation_model = np.array([[0.8, 0.2],
                              [0.4, 0.6]])

# Initialize the belief state (prior distribution over states)
belief_state = np.array([0.5, 0.5])

# Perform active inference to update the belief state based on observations
def update_belief(observation):
    # Compute the likelihood of the observation given each state
    likelihoods = observation_model[:, observation]
    
    # Update the belief state using Bayes' rule
    new_belief_state = np.multiply(transition_model, likelihoods)
    new_belief_state /= np.sum(new_belief_state)
    
    return new_belief_state

# Simulate observations over time
for t in range(10):
    observation = np.random.choice(states)
    belief_state = update_belief(observation)

print("Predicted fabric quality:", np.argmax(belief_state))
```

## 6. Practical Applications and Implementations

This involves maintaining probabilistic beliefs about consumer preferences and selecting actions that reduce uncertainty about design parameters. For example, an automated design system could use active inference to create personalized fabrics based on user input[5].

```python
# Example of automated fabric design using Active Inference
import numpy as np

# Define the state space (design parameters)
states = np.array([0, 1])  # Parameter 1, Parameter 2

# Define the transition model (probability of moving from one state to another)
transition_model = np.array([[0.9, 0.1],
                             [0.3, 0.7]])

# Define the observation model (probability of observing a certain condition given the true state)
observation_model = np.array([[0.8, 0.2],
                              [0.4, 0.6]])

# Initialize the belief state (prior distribution over states)
belief_state = np.array([0.5, 0.5])

# Perform active inference to update the belief state based on observations
def update_belief(observation):
    # Compute the likelihood of the observation given each state
    likelihoods = observation_model[:, observation]
    
    # Update the belief state using Bayes' rule
    new_belief_state = np.multiply(transition_model, likelihoods)
    new_belief_state /= np.sum(new_belief_state)
    
    return new_belief_state

# Simulate observations over time
for t in range(10):
    observation = np.random.choice(states)
    belief_state = update_belief(observation)

print("Predicted design parameters:", np.argmax(belief_state))
```

### Optimized Production Planning

Active inference can be used to optimize production schedules and resource allocation. This involves maintaining probabilistic beliefs about production conditions and selecting actions that reduce uncertainty about critical variables. For example, a production planning system could use active inference to predict production delays and allocate resources accordingly[5].

```python
# Example of optimized production planning using Active Inference
import numpy as np

# Define the state space (production conditions)
states = np.array([0, 1])  # Delayed, On Schedule

# Define the transition model (probability of moving from one state to another)
transition_model = np.array([[0.9, 0.1],
                             [0.3, 0.7]])

# Define the observation model (probability of observing a certain condition given the true state)
observation_model = np.array([[0.8, 0.2],
                              [0.4, 0.6]])

# Initialize the belief state (prior distribution over states)
belief_state = np.array([0.5, 0.5])

# Perform active inference to update the belief state based on observations
def update_belief(observation):
    # Compute the likelihood of the observation given each state
    likelihoods = observation_model[:, observation]
    
    # Update the belief state using Bayes' rule
    new_belief_state = np.multiply(transition_model, likelihoods)
    new_belief_state /= np.sum(new_belief_state)
    
    return new_belief_state

# Simulate observations over time
for t in range(10):
    observation = np.random.choice(states)
    belief_state = update_belief(observation)

print("Predicted production conditions:", np.argmax(belief_state))
```
