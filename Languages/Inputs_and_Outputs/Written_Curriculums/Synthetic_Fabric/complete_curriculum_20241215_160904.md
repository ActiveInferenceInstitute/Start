For example, an autonomous textile inspection system could use active inference to predict when a fabric is likely to degrade, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime[5].

```python
# Example of predictive maintenance using Active Inference
import numpy as np

# Define the state space (fabric condition)
states = np.array([0, 1, 2])  # Healthy, Degraded, Failed

# Define the transition model (probability of moving from one state to another)
transition_model = np.array([[0.9, 0.1, 0],
                             [0.3, 0.7, 0],
                             [0, 0, 1]])

# Define the observation model (probability of observing a certain condition given the true state)
observation_model = np.array([[0.8, 0.2, 0],
                              [0.4, 0.6, 0],
                              [0, 0, 1]])

# Initialize the belief state (prior distribution over states)
belief_state = np.array([0.5, 0.3, 0.2])

# Perform active inference to update the belief state based on observations
def update_belief(observation):
    # Compute the likelihood of the observation given each state
    likelihoods = observation_model[:, observation]
    
    # Update the belief state using Bayes' rule
    new_belief_state = np.multiply(transition_model, likelihoods)
    new_belief_state /= np.sum(new_belief_state)
    
    return new_belief_state

# Simulate observations over time
for t in range(10):
    observation = np.random.choice(states)
    belief_state = update_belief(observation)

print("Predicted fabric condition:", np.argmax(belief_state))
```

### Quality Control

Active inference can also be applied to detect anomalies in fabric quality during production. This involves maintaining probabilistic beliefs about fabric quality and selecting actions that reduce uncertainty about critical variables. For example, a quality control system could use active inference to detect defects in real-time, allowing for immediate corrective action[5].

```python

belief_state = np.array([0.5, 0.5])

# Perform active inference to update the belief state based on observations
def update_belief(observation):
    # Compute the likelihood of the observation given each state
    likelihoods = observation_model[:, observation]
    
    # Update the belief state using Bayes' rule
    new_belief_state = np.multiply(transition_model, likelihoods)
    new_belief_state /= np.sum(new_belief_state)
    
    return new_belief_state

# Simulate observations over time
for t in range(10):
    observation = np.random.choice(states)
    belief_state = update_belief(observation)

    # Compute the likelihood of the observation given each state
    likelihoods = observation_model[:, observation]
    
    # Update the belief state using Bayes' rule
    new_belief_state = np.multiply(transition_model, likelihoods)
    new_belief_state /= np.sum(new_belief_state)
    
    return new_belief_state

                             [0.3, 0.7]])

# Define the observation model (probability of observing a certain condition given the true state)
observation_model = np.array([[0.8, 0.2],
                              [0.4, 0.6]])

# Initialize the belief state (prior distribution over states)
belief_state = np.array([0.5, 0.5])

# Perform active inference to update the belief state based on observations
def update_belief(observation):
    # Compute the likelihood of the observation given each state
    likelihoods = observation_model[:, observation]
    
    # Update the belief state using Bayes' rule
    new_belief_state = np.multiply(transition_model, likelihoods)
    new_belief_state /= np.sum(new_belief_state)
    
    return new_belief_state

F = D_{KL}(q(z|x) || p(z)) + H(q(z|x))
\]
where \( D_{KL} \) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and \( H \) is the entropy[3].

## Predictive Coding

### Definition

Predictive coding is a theory of neural processing where the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors.

### Example

In visual perception, higher cortical areas predict the activity of lower areas, with only the differences between predictions and actual input being propagated upwards. During speech comprehension, the brain predicts upcoming words based on context, with unexpected words generating larger neural responses (prediction errors)[3].

## Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)

### Definition

POMDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty where an agent cannot directly observe the full state of its environment.

### Example

An agent's internal model in active inference can be viewed as maintaining beliefs over hidden states in a POMDP, with actions selected to minimize expected free energy. The partial observability in POMDPs aligns with the FEP's emphasis on organisms operating under incomplete information about their environment[3].

## Conclusion

Active Inference offers a powerful framework for enhancing decision-making processes in various domains, including the textile industry. By integrating predictive modeling, generative models, and variational free energy minimization, Active Inference can optimize fabric design, predict production outcomes, and streamline quality control processes. The practical applications of Active Inference in the textile industry include automated fabric design, predictive maintenance, and quality control. This curriculum provides a comprehensive introduction to Active Inference and its applications in the textile industry, ensuring that participants gain a deep understanding of both theoretical concepts and practical implementations.
