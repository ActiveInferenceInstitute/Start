## The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

### Definition and Core Concepts

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theory proposing that all adaptive systems minimize their variational free energy to maintain their structural and functional integrity[3]. Active inference is a corollary of the FEP, suggesting that organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise[3].

#### Key Quantities and Formalizations
1. **Surprise**: The difference between the actual state of the world and an organism's internal model.
2. **Entropy**: A measure of disorder or uncertainty.
3. **KL-Divergence**: A measure of the difference between two probability distributions.

The variational free energy can be mathematically expressed as the sum of accuracy (expected log-likelihood) and complexity (KL divergence between posterior and prior beliefs)[3].

### Applications in Biological Systems

1. **Predictive Coding**: The brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors[3].
2. **Learning and Adaptation**: Learning involves updating generative models to improve their predictive accuracy, which is essential for minimizing free energy[3].
3. **Decision-Making**: Active inference involves choosing actions to gather information that improves the generative model, reducing uncertainty about the environment[3].

### Implications for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

1. **Generative Models**: Artificial neural networks designed to minimize prediction errors in a hierarchical manner show improved performance in various tasks[3].
2. **Active Learning**: AI systems based on the FEP might exhibit emergent properties analogous to consciousness or self-awareness as they develop increasingly complex internal models[3].
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The use of reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize decision-making in AI can be seen as minimizing free energy[3].

### Variational Free Energy

1. **Definition**: Variational free energy is a measure of the difference between an organism's internal model of the world and the actual state of the world, serving as a proxy for surprise[3].
2. **Minimization**: Minimizing variational free energy involves both perceptual inference (updating internal models) and active inference (acting on the environment)[3].

### Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)

1. **Definition**: POMDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty where an agent cannot directly observe the full state of its environment[3].
2. **Active Inference**: Active inference in POMDPs involves both perception (state estimation) and action (policy selection) aimed at minimizing expected free energy[3].

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Integrate Active Inference for better predictions
from pyinfer import ActiveInference

ai = ActiveInference(model)
ai.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions_ai = ai.predict(X_test)

print("Predictions with Active Inference:", predictions_ai)
```

#### Example 2: Real-Time Monitoring
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

# Simulate sensor data
sensor_data = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=100)

# Define a simple generative model for sensor data
def generative_model(sensor_data):
    return norm.pdf(sensor_data, loc=0, scale=1)

# Integrate Active Inference for real-time monitoring
from pyinfer import ActiveInference

ai = ActiveInference(generative_model)
ai.fit(sensor_data)
posterior_distribution = ai.posterior_distribution()

print("Posterior Distribution:", posterior_distribution)
```

## The Free Energy Principle

### Definition

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theory proposing that all adaptive systems minimize their variational free energy to maintain their structural and functional integrity[2][5].

### Key Concepts

#### Variational Free Energy

Variational free energy is a measure of the difference between an organism's internal model of the world and the actual state of the world, serving as a proxy for surprise[2][5].

\[ F(q, x, \theta) = -\log p(x | \theta) + KL(q || p(\theta)) \]

Where:
- \( q \) is the variational distribution over the parameters,
- \( x \) is the observed data,
- \( \theta \) is the true parameters,
- \( KL(q || p(\theta)) \) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between \( q \) and \( p(\theta) \).

#### Predictive Coding

Predictive coding is a theory of neural processing where the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors[2][5].

\[ P(y | x) = P(y) * P(x | y) / P(x) \]

Where:
- \( P(y | x) \) is the posterior probability of \( y \) given \( x \),
- \( P(y) \) is the prior probability of \( y \),
- \( P(x | y) \) is the likelihood of \( x \) given \( y \),
- \( P(x) \) is the marginal likelihood of \( x \).

#### Active Inference

Active inference is a corollary of the Free Energy Principle, suggesting that organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise[2][5].

\[ A = E[Q] + H[Q] + I[X;Q] \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the action taken,
- \( E[Q] \) is the expected value of the variational distribution,
- \( H[Q] \) is the entropy of the variational distribution,
- \( I[X;Q] \) is the mutual information between the observed data and the variational distribution.

### Implications for Artificial Intelligence

The Free Energy Principle provides a mathematical framework for understanding perception, learning, and decision-making in biological systems, which can be extended to artificial intelligence and machine learning[2][5].

#### Generative Models

Generative models are internal representations of the world used by an organism or system to generate predictions about sensory inputs and guide actions[2][5].

\[ G(z | x) = P(z | x) * P(x | z) / P(x) \]

Where:
- \( G(z | x) \) is the generative model,
- \( P(z | x) \) is the posterior probability of \( z \) given \( x \),
- \( P(x | z) \) is the likelihood of \( x \) given \( z \),
- \( P(x) \) is the marginal likelihood of \( x \).

#### Learning

Learning in the Free Energy Principle framework can be understood as the process of updating generative models to improve their predictive accuracy[2][5].

\[ L(\theta | x) = E[Q(\theta | x)] + H[Q(\theta | x)] + I[X;Q(\theta | x)] \]

Where:
- \( L(\theta | x) \) is the learning process,
- \( E[Q(\theta | x)] \) is the expected value of the variational distribution,
- \( H[Q(\theta | x)] \) is the entropy of the variational distribution,
- \( I[X;Q(\theta | x)] \) is the mutual information between the observed data and the variational distribution.
