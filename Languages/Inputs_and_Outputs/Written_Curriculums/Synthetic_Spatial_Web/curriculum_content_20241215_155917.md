# Example of variational free energy calculation
import numpy as np

def variational_free_energy(q, x, theta):
    accuracy = -np.log(observation_likelihood(x, theta))
    complexity = KL_divergence(q, prior)
    return accuracy + complexity

# Observation likelihood function
def observation_likelihood(x, theta):
    return np.exp(-np.sum((x - theta) ** 2))

# KL divergence function
def KL_divergence(q, prior):
    return np.sum(q * np.log(q / prior))
```

## The Free Energy Principle

### Definition

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theory proposing that all adaptive systems minimize their variational free energy to maintain their structural and functional integrity[2][5].

### Key Concepts

#### Variational Free Energy

Variational free energy is a measure of the difference between an organism's internal model of the world and the actual state of the world, serving as a proxy for surprise[2][5].

\[ F(q, x, \theta) = -\log p(x | \theta) + KL(q || p(\theta)) \]

Where:
- \( q \) is the variational distribution over the parameters,
- \( x \) is the observed data,
- \( \theta \) is the true parameters,
- \( KL(q || p(\theta)) \) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between \( q \) and \( p(\theta) \).

#### Predictive Coding

Predictive coding is a theory of neural processing where the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors[2][5].

\[ P(y | x) = P(y) * P(x | y) / P(x) \]

Where:
- \( P(y | x) \) is the posterior probability of \( y \) given \( x \),
- \( P(y) \) is the prior probability of \( y \),
- \( P(x | y) \) is the likelihood of \( x \) given \( y \),
- \( P(x) \) is the marginal likelihood of \( x \).

#### Active Inference

Active inference is a corollary of the Free Energy Principle, suggesting that organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise[2][5].

\[ A = E[Q] + H[Q] + I[X;Q] \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the action taken,
- \( E[Q] \) is the expected value of the variational distribution,
- \( H[Q] \) is the entropy of the variational distribution,
- \( I[X;Q] \) is the mutual information between the observed data and the variational distribution.

### Implications for Artificial Intelligence

The Free Energy Principle provides a mathematical framework for understanding perception, learning, and decision-making in biological systems, which can be extended to artificial intelligence and machine learning[2][5].

#### Generative Models

Generative models are internal representations of the world used by an organism or system to generate predictions about sensory inputs and guide actions[2][5].

\[ G(z | x) = P(z | x) * P(x | z) / P(x) \]

Where:
- \( G(z | x) \) is the generative model,
- \( P(z | x) \) is the posterior probability of \( z \) given \( x \),
- \( P(x | z) \) is the likelihood of \( x \) given \( z \),
- \( P(x) \) is the marginal likelihood of \( x \).

#### Learning

Learning in the Free Energy Principle framework can be understood as the process of updating generative models to improve their predictive accuracy[2][5].

\[ L(\theta | x) = E[Q(\theta | x)] + H[Q(\theta | x)] + I[X;Q(\theta | x)] \]

Where:
- \( L(\theta | x) \) is the learning process,
- \( E[Q(\theta | x)] \) is the expected value of the variational distribution,
- \( H[Q(\theta | x)] \) is the entropy of the variational distribution,
- \( I[X;Q(\theta | x)] \) is the mutual information between the observed data and the variational distribution.
