## Theoretical Foundations of Active Inference

### Definition of Active Inference

Active inference is a corollary of the Free Energy Principle (FEP), suggesting that organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise[3]. This principle is central to understanding perception, learning, and decision-making in biological systems.

2. **Generative Models**:
   - Generative models are internal representations of the world used by an organism or system to generate predictions about sensory inputs and guide actions[3].
   - These models are often hierarchical, with higher levels encoding more abstract or general information.

3. **Predictive Coding**:
   - Predictive coding is a theory of neural processing where the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors[3].
