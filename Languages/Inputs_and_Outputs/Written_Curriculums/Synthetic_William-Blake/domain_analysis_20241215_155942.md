2. **Symbolic Representation**
   - Both involve symbolic representations (text in literature, images in art) that need to be interpreted. In Blake's illuminated books, the text and images exist in a dialectical relationship, requiring a nuanced understanding of both the literal and symbolic meanings[3].

3. **Dynamic Interactions**
   - Both involve dynamic interactions between different elements (characters in a story, colors in an image). In Blake's work, this can be seen in the interplay between light and darkness, good and evil, reflecting his concept of "contraries"[1][5].

#### Natural Analogies and Metaphors

1. **Imagination as Active Inference**
   - Blake's emphasis on imagination can be seen as analogous to the active inference process, where the mind generates hypotheses about the world. This involves the continuous generation of predictions and the refinement of these predictions based on sensory feedback, similar to how active inference operates in biological systems[1][5].

2. **Reason vs. Imagination**
   - The conflict between reason and imagination in Blake's work mirrors the tension between prior knowledge and new sensory data in active inference. This reflects his philosophical views on the limitations of reason and the power of imagination in understanding the world[1][5].

#### Shared Mathematical or Theoretical Foundations

1. **Bayesian Inference**
   - The process of active inference can be seen as a form of Bayesian inference, where prior knowledge is updated based on new data. This involves the use of probability distributions to model uncertainty and update beliefs, similar to how Bayesian inference operates in machine learning and cognitive science[4].

2. **Cognitive Architectures**
   - Both involve complex cognitive architectures that integrate multiple sources of information. In Blake's work, this can be seen in the interplay between different levels of meaning in his illuminated books, where text and images work together to convey deeper insights[3].

#### Potential Applications of Active Inference

1. **Literary Analysis**
   - Applying active inference techniques to analyze complex literary texts by generating hypotheses about themes and symbolism. This involves using predictive coding to understand how the brain processes and interprets literary texts, similar to how it processes sensory inputs[4].

2. **Artistic Interpretation**
   - Using active inference to interpret visual art by considering the artist's intentions and the cultural context. This involves understanding how the artist's predictions about the viewer's experience are updated based on sensory feedback, similar to how active inference operates in perception and action[4].

#### Integration Opportunities
