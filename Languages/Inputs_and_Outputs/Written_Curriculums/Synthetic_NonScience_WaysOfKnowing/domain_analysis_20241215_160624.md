## Core FEP/Active Inference Content

### Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

#### Definition
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theory proposing that all adaptive systems minimize their variational free energy to maintain their structural and functional integrity[4].

#### Example Applications
- **Biological Systems**: A cell maintaining its internal chemical balance despite environmental fluctuations can be understood as minimizing its free energy. The human brain's predictive processing, constantly generating and updating internal models of the world, exemplifies free energy minimization[4].
- **Behavioral Adaptations**: An organism's behavioral adaptations to its environment can be seen as attempts to minimize surprise and, consequently, free energy. A plant adjusting its growth direction towards light sources to optimize photosynthesis can be viewed as minimizing free energy[4].
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Artificial neural networks designed to minimize prediction errors in a hierarchical manner, similar to predictive coding in the brain, show improved performance in various tasks. Robotics systems incorporating active inference principles demonstrate more adaptive and robust behavior in complex environments[4].

#### Mathematical Formalization
The mathematical formalization of FEP involves key quantities like surprise, entropy, and KL-divergence. The variational free energy can be mathematically expressed as the sum of accuracy (expected log-likelihood) and complexity (KL divergence between posterior and prior beliefs)[4].

#### Active Inference
Active inference is a corollary of the Free Energy Principle, suggesting that organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise. An animal foraging for food in familiar territory uses its internal model to predict where food is likely to be found, acting to confirm these predictions[4].

### Generative Model

#### Definition
A generative model is an internal representation of the world used by an organism or system to generate predictions about sensory inputs and guide actions[4].

#### Example Applications
- **Visual Perception**: The visual cortex's hierarchical structure can be seen as a generative model for visual perception, predicting complex visual scenes from simpler features. An animal's cognitive map of its environment serves as a generative model for spatial navigation and foraging behavior[4].
- **Social Cognition**: A person's understanding of social norms acts as a generative model for predicting and interpreting social interactions. The brain's representation of body posture and movement serves as a generative model for motor control[4].

#### Model Evidence
Model evidence refers to the probability of sensory data given a particular generative model. The accuracy of visual predictions in different lighting conditions reflects the model evidence of the brain's visual generative model. An organism's ability to thrive in its ecological niche demonstrates high model evidence for its evolved generative models of that environment[4].

### Variational Free Energy

#### Definition
Variational free energy is a measure of the difference between an organism's internal model of the world and the actual state of the world, serving as a proxy for surprise[4].

#### Example Applications
- **Learning Process**: The process of learning a new skill involves reducing variational free energy as the learner's internal model becomes more aligned with the task requirements. In visual perception, the initial confusion when viewing an optical illusion represents high variational free energy, which decreases as the brain resolves the ambiguity[4].
- **Decision-Making**: Active inference in decision-making under uncertainty involves minimizing expected free energy. An agent's internal model in active inference can be viewed as maintaining beliefs over hidden states in a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process), with actions selected to minimize expected free energy[4].

### Predictive Coding

#### Definition
Predictive coding is a theory of neural processing where the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors[4].

#### Example Applications
- **Visual Perception**: In visual perception, higher cortical areas predict the activity of lower areas, with only the differences between predictions and actual input being propagated upwards. During speech comprehension, the brain predicts upcoming words based on context, with unexpected words generating larger neural responses (prediction errors)[4].
- **Motor Control**: In motor control, the cerebellum generates predictions about the sensory consequences of movements, with discrepancies driving motor learning[4].

### Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)

#### Definition
POMDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty where an agent cannot directly observe the full state of its environment[4].

#### Example Applications
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: An autonomous vehicle using active inference would maintain probabilistic beliefs about road conditions while selecting actions that reduce uncertainty about critical variables. A foraging animal must simultaneously infer the locations of food sources (hidden states) while selecting movement policies that balance exploration and exploitation[4].

## Connecting Ideas Across Different Domains

### Holistic Approaches and Active Inference

#### Holistic Worldviews
Holistic worldviews recognize the interconnectedness of various aspects of life and the universe. This perspective is fundamental in both non-science ways of knowing and active inference. For instance, in traditional Chinese medicine, qi represents an energy that flows through the body, influencing overall health. Similarly, in active inference, the brain's internal models are interconnected, influencing perception and action[2][4].

#### Subjective Experience
Subjective experience plays a crucial role in both domains. In non-science ways of knowing, subjective experiences are often used to understand ecological relationships and cultural practices. In active inference, internal states like beliefs and desires are central to understanding behavior and decision-making. The brain's ability to predict and update its internal models based on sensory input exemplifies this subjective experience[2][4].

### Practical Applications

#### Holistic Health Clinics
Integrating active inference with mindfulness practices in holistic health clinics could enhance patient well-being and treatment outcomes. For example, a patient's internal model of their condition could be continuously updated based on sensory feedback, leading to more effective treatment strategies[4].

#### Environmental Conservation
Combining active inference with indigenous ecological knowledge could develop more sustainable environmental management practices. For instance, an indigenous community's traditional knowledge about local ecosystems could be integrated with active inference models to predict and mitigate the impact of environmental changes[4].

#### Conflict Resolution
Using active inference to model internal states could help in conflict resolution by understanding the subjective experiences of all parties involved. This approach could facilitate more effective communication and negotiation strategies[4].
