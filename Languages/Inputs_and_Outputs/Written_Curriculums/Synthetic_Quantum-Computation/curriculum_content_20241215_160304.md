2. **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Quantum mechanics involves probabilistic reasoning, similar to Active Inference's probabilistic nature. This is evident in the use of wave functions in quantum mechanics and the probabilistic graphical models in Active Inference.
3. **Complex Systems**: Both domains deal with complex systems, whether it's quantum systems or probabilistic graphical models. This complexity is managed through hierarchical processing in both domains.

#### Mathematical Principles with Domain-Relevant Examples

1. **Variational Free Energy**: The variational free energy can be mathematically expressed as the sum of accuracy (expected log-likelihood) and complexity (KL divergence between posterior and prior beliefs).

## Core FEP/Active Inference Content

### Definition and Examples

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theory proposing that all adaptive systems minimize their variational free energy to maintain their structural and functional integrity. This principle is central to Active Inference, which suggests that organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise.

**Examples:**
- **Cellular Balance:** A cell maintaining its internal chemical balance despite environmental fluctuations can be understood as minimizing its free energy[1].
- **Brain's Predictive Processing:** The human brain's predictive processing, constantly generating and updating internal models of the world, exemplifies free energy minimization[1].
- **Behavioral Adaptations:** An organism's behavioral adaptations to its environment can be seen as attempts to minimize surprise and, consequently, free energy[1].

### Mathematical Formalization

The mathematical formalization of FEP involves key quantities like surprise, entropy, and KL-divergence. The variational free energy can be mathematically expressed as the sum of accuracy (expected log-likelihood) and complexity (KL divergence between posterior and prior beliefs).

**Equation:**
\[ F = D_{KL}(q||p) + E_{q}[L(\theta, x)] \]
where \( F \) is the variational free energy, \( D_{KL} \) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, \( q \) is the posterior distribution, \( p \) is the prior distribution, \( L \) is the log-likelihood function, and \( \theta \) are the model parameters[1].

### Active Inference

Active inference is a corollary of the Free Energy Principle, suggesting that organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise. This involves both perceptual inference (updating internal models) and active inference (acting on the environment).

**Examples:**
- **Foraging Behavior:** An animal foraging for food in familiar territory uses its internal model to predict where food is likely to be found, acting to confirm these predictions[1].
- **Motor Control:** A person reaching for a cup uses active inference to continuously update their motor commands based on sensory feedback, minimizing prediction errors[1].

### Generative Models

A generative model is an internal representation of the world used by an organism or system to generate predictions about sensory inputs and guide actions. Generative models in biological systems are often hierarchical, with higher levels encoding more abstract or general information.

**Examples:**
- **Visual Cortex:** The visual cortex's hierarchical structure can be seen as a generative model for visual perception, predicting complex visual scenes from simpler features[1].
- **Cognitive Map:** An animal's cognitive map of its environment serves as a generative model for spatial navigation and foraging behavior[1].

### Variational Free Energy

Variational free energy is a measure of the difference between an organism's internal model of the world and the actual state of the world, serving as a proxy for surprise. Minimizing variational free energy involves both perceptual inference (updating internal models) and active inference (acting on the environment).

**Examples:**
- **Learning a New Skill:** The process of learning a new skill involves reducing variational free energy as the learner's internal model becomes more aligned with the task requirements[1].
- **Visual Perception:** In visual perception, the initial confusion when viewing an optical illusion represents high variational free energy, which decreases as the brain resolves the ambiguity[1].

### Predictive Coding

Predictive coding is a theory of neural processing where the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors. This process is crucial for minimizing variational free energy.

**Examples:**
- **Visual Perception:** In visual perception, higher cortical areas predict the activity of lower areas, with only the differences between predictions and actual input being propagated upwards[1].
- **Speech Comprehension:** During speech comprehension, the brain predicts upcoming words based on context, with unexpected words generating larger neural responses (prediction errors)[1].

### Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)

POMDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty where an agent cannot directly observe the full state of its environment. Active inference in POMDPs involves both perception (state estimation) and action (policy selection) aimed at minimizing expected free energy.

**Examples:**
- **Autonomous Vehicle:** An autonomous vehicle using active inference would maintain probabilistic beliefs about road conditions while selecting actions that reduce uncertainty about critical variables[1].
- **Foraging Animal:** A foraging animal must simultaneously infer the locations of food sources (hidden states) while selecting movement policies that balance exploration and exploitation[1].

circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)

# Add gates to the circuit

circuit.cx(0, 1)

# Run the circuit on a simulator
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(circuit, backend)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(circuit)
print(counts)
```
