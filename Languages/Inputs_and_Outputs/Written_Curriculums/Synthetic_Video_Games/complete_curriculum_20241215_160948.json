Implications for Mental Health\n\n### 7.1 Understanding Anxiety Disorders\n\n**Explanation**: Anxiety disorders might be interpreted as maladaptive attempts to minimize variational free energy, resulting in overly cautious behavior and hypervigilance to potential threats.\n\n### 7.2 Understanding Depression\n\n**Explanation**: Depression could be viewed as a state of high variational free energy, where the individual's internal model fails to effectively predict and engage with the environment.\n\n## 8.
