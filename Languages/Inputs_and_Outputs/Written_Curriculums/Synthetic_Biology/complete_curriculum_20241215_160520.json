\\( MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\)\n  - Where \\( y_i \\) is the actual value and \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value.\n\n- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n  - \\( MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i| \\)\n  - Where \\( y_i \\) is the actual value and \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value.\n\n#### Model Complexity\n\n- **Regularization Strength**\n  - Regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization can be used to control model complexity.\n  - For example, L1 regularization adds a term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model parameters.\n  - L2 regularization adds a term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model parameters.\n\n---\n\nBy following this structured approach, you will be able to effectively apply Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle in ecological research and conservation efforts, enhancing predictive accuracy and optimizing decision-making processes.\n\n---\n\n###"
