  - Where \( y_i \) is the actual value and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value.

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - \( MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i| \)
  - Where \( y_i \) is the actual value and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value.

#### Model Complexity

- **Regularization Strength**
  - Regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization can be used to control model complexity.
  - For example, L1 regularization adds a term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model parameters.
  - L2 regularization adds a term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model parameters.
