## Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

### Definition

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theory proposing that all adaptive systems minimize their variational free energy to maintain their structural and functional integrity. This principle is central to Active Inference, which suggests that organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise.

### Examples

1. **Cellular Homeostasis**: A cell maintaining its internal chemical balance despite environmental fluctuations can be understood as minimizing its free energy.
2. **Predictive Processing**: The human brain's predictive processing, constantly generating and updating internal models of the world, exemplifies free energy minimization.
3. **Behavioral Adaptation**: An organism's behavioral adaptations to its environment can be seen as attempts to minimize surprise and, consequently, free energy.
4. **Plant Growth**: A plant adjusting its growth direction towards light sources to optimize photosynthesis can be viewed as minimizing free energy.
5. **Schooling Behavior**: A fish swimming in a school to reduce predation risk and improve foraging efficiency exemplifies free energy minimization.
6. **Migration Patterns**: A bird migrating seasonally to exploit different ecological niches can be seen as minimizing free energy.
7. **Chemotaxis**: A bacterium moving towards a nutrient source through chemotaxis is an example of free energy minimization.

### Mathematical Formalization

The mathematical formalization of FEP involves key quantities like surprise, entropy, and KL-divergence. The variational free energy can be mathematically expressed as the sum of accuracy (expected log-likelihood) and complexity (KL divergence between posterior and prior beliefs).

```math
F = D_{KL}(q(z|x) || p(z)) + E_{q(z|x)}[log p(x|z)]
```

### Generative Models

A generative model in Active Inference is an internal representation of the world used by an organism or system to generate predictions about sensory inputs and guide actions. This concept aligns with the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex or cognitive maps in animals.

```math
p(x) = ∫ p(x|z) p(z) dz
```

### Learning

Learning in the FEP framework can be understood as the process of updating generative models to improve their predictive accuracy. Perceptual learning, motor skill acquisition, scientific progress, and language acquisition all involve refining generative models.

### Adaptation to Rapidly Changing Environments

Generative models adapt to rapidly changing environments or novel situations by updating their internal representations based on new sensory information. This adaptability is crucial for survival and efficiency in various biological and cognitive systems.

### Limitations of Artificial Generative Models

While AI language models can generate coherent text, they often lack the deep contextual understanding and common sense reasoning of human language generative models. Computer vision systems struggle with robustness and generalization capabilities compared to the human visual system. AI systems require vast amounts of data for training, whereas biological systems can learn efficiently from limited examples.

### Variational Free Energy

The variational free energy is a measure of the difference between an organism's internal model of the world and the actual state of the world, serving as a proxy for surprise. Minimizing variational free energy is equivalent to maximizing both the accuracy and complexity of an organism's internal model.

```math
F = D_{KL}(q(z|x) || p(z)) + E_{q(z|x)}[log p(x|z)]
```

### Predictive Coding

Predictive coding is a theory of neural processing where the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors. This process drives both perception and learning.

### Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)

POMDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty where an agent cannot directly observe the full state of its environment. Active inference in POMDPs involves both perception (state estimation) and action (policy selection) aimed at minimizing expected free energy.

# Compile model with appropriate loss function and optimizer
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

# Train model on encrypted data
encrypted_data = # Encrypted data from RSA encryption process
labels = # Corresponding labels for training data

model.fit(encrypted_data, labels)

# Use trained model to predict anomalies in encrypted data
def detect_anomalies(data):
    predictions = model.predict(data)
    anomalies = []
    for prediction in predictions:
        if prediction > threshold:
            anomalies.append(data)
    return anomalies

anomalies = detect_anomalies(encrypted_data)
