   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load historical data
   df = pd.read_csv('negotiation_data.csv')

   # Define features and target variable
   X = df[['contextual_factors', 'historical_outcomes']]
   y = df['outcome']

   ```
   [Source: Data-Driven Negotiation][# Practical Applications]

2. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Use real-time data and probabilistic reasoning from Active Inference to adapt negotiation tactics dynamically.

### Cutting-Edge Research Relevant to Domain

1. **AI Integration**: Explore how AI systems based on the Free Energy Principle might exhibit emergent properties analogous to consciousness or self-awareness.
   Example:
   ```python
   # Example of an AI system integrating FEP principles
   import torch

   class FEP_Agent:
       def __init__(self):
           self.model = torch.nn.Sequential(
               torch.nn.Linear(784, 128),
               torch.nn.ReLU(),
               torch.nn.Linear(128, 10)
           )

       def predict(self, x):
           return self.model(x)

       def update(self, x, y):
           loss = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(self.predict(x), y)
           optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
           optimizer.zero_grad()
           loss.backward()
           optimizer.step()

   agent = FEP_Agent()
   agent.update(x_train, y_train)
   ```

2. **Generative Models in AI**: Discuss the development of generative models in AI to predict and simulate complex environments.
   Example:
   ```r
   # Example of a generative model in R
   library(keras)

   model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
       layer_dense(units = 64, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(784)) %>%
       layer_dense(units = 32, activation = 'relu') %>%
       layer_dense(units = 784, activation = 'sigmoid')

   model %>% compile(
       loss = 'binary_crossentropy',
       optimizer = optimizer_adam(),
       metrics = c('accuracy')
   )

   model %>% fit(
       x_train,
       y_train,
       epochs = 10,
       batch_size = 128,
       validation_data = list(x_test, y_test)
   )
   ```
