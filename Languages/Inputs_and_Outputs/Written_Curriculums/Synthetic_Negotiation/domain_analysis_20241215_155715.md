# Load historical data on international trade agreements
data = pd.read_csv('trade_agreements.csv')

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('outcome', axis=1), data['outcome'], test_size=0.2)

# Train a logistic regression model

from scipy.stats import norm

# Define a function to calculate risk levels
def calculate_risk(cultural_differences, power_imbalance):
    # Use probabilistic reasoning to assess risk levels
    risk_level = norm.cdf(cultural_differences + power_imbalance)
    return risk_level

# Example usage:
