structural and functional integrity[4].\n\n### Examples\n- **Cellular Balance**: A cell maintaining its internal chemical balance despite environmental fluctuations can be understood as minimizing its free energy.\n- **Predictive Processing**: The human brain's predictive processing, constantly generating and updating internal models of the world, exemplifies free energy minimization.\n- **Behavioral Adaptations**: An organism's behavioral adaptations to its environment can be seen as attempts to minimize surprise and, consequently, free energy.\n- **Plant Growth**: A plant adjusting its growth direction towards light sources to optimize photosynthesis can be viewed as minimizing free energy.\n- **Schooling Behavior**: A fish swimming in a school to reduce predation risk and improve foraging efficiency exemplifies free energy minimization.\n- **Migration Patterns**: A bird migrating seasonally to exploit different ecological niches can be seen as minimizing free energy.\n- **Chemotaxis**: A bacterium moving towards a nutrient source through chemotaxis is an example of free energy minimization.\n\n### Mathematical Formalization\nThe mathematical formalization of FEP involves key quantities like surprise, entropy, and KL-divergence[4].\n\n### Active Inference\nActive inference is a corollary of the Free Energy Principle, suggesting that organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise[4].\n\n### Examples\n- **Foraging Behavior**: An animal foraging for food in familiar territory uses its internal model to predict where food is likely to be found, acting to confirm these predictions.\n- **Motor Control**: A person reaching for a cup uses active inference to continuously update their motor commands based on sensory feedback,

organism or system to generate predictions about sensory inputs and guide actions[4].\n\n### Examples\n- **Visual Perception**: The visual cortex's hierarchical structure can be seen as a generative model for visual perception, predicting complex visual scenes from simpler features.\n- **Cognitive Maps**: An animal's cognitive map of its environment serves as a generative model for spatial navigation and foraging behavior.\n- **Social Norms**: A person's understanding of social norms acts as a generative model for predicting and interpreting social interactions.\n- **Motor Control**:

serving as a proxy for surprise[4].\n\n### Examples\n- **Learning a New Skill**: The process of learning a new skill involves reducing variational free energy as the learner's internal model becomes more aligned with the task requirements.\n- **Visual Perception**: The initial confusion when viewing an optical illusion represents high variational free energy, which decreases as the brain resolves the ambiguity.\n- **Scientific Theories**: The effectiveness of a scientific theory in predicting experimental outcomes is a measure of its model evidence.\n\n## Predictive Coding\n\n### Definition\nPredictive coding is a theory of neural processing where the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors[4].\n\n### Examples\n- **Visual Perception**: Higher cortical areas predict the activity of lower areas, with only the differences between predictions and actual input being propagated upwards.\n- **Speech Comprehension**: During speech comprehension, the brain predicts upcoming words based on context, with unexpected words generating larger neural responses (prediction errors).\n- **Motor Control**: The cerebellum generates predictions about the sensory consequences of movements, with discrepancies driving motor learning.\n\n## Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)\n\n### Definition\nPOMDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty where an agent cannot directly observe the full state of its environment[4].\n\n### Examples\n- **Autonomous Vehicles**: An autonomous vehicle using active inference would maintain probabilistic beliefs about road conditions while selecting actions that reduce uncertainty about critical variables.\n- **Foraging Animals**: A foraging animal must simultaneously infer the locations of food sources (hidden states) while selecting movement policies that balance exploration and exploitation.\n- **Social Robots**: A social robot learning to interact with humans must maintain beliefs about users' intentions while selecting actions that resolve uncertainty about social cues.\n\n## Implications for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\n### Examples\n- **Artificial Neural Networks**: Artificial neural networks designed to minimize prediction errors in a hierarchical manner, similar to predictive coding in the brain, show improved performance in various tasks.\n- **Robotics Systems**: Robotics systems incorporating active inference principles demonstrate more adaptive and robust behavior in complex, changing environments.\n- **Generative Models**: AI systems based on the Free Energy Principle might exhibit emergent properties analogous to consciousness or self-awareness as they develop increasingly complex internal models.\n- **Reinforcement Learning**: The use of reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize decision-making in AI can
