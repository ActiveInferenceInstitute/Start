### Conceptual Bridges

#### Connecting Concepts to FEP/Active Inference
1. **Information Realism**: The idea that information is more fundamental than matter or energy can be bridged with FEP by understanding how organisms minimize variational free energy to maintain their internal models of the world[1][5].
2. **Quantum Cognition**: The application of quantum mechanical principles to cognition can be connected to FEP through the lens of active inference, where organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise[4].
3. **Embodied Cognition**: The deep-rooted interaction between cognitive processes and the body's environment can be linked to FEP by understanding how organisms maintain their internal models through sensory feedback and action[1][5].

#### Analogies and Metaphors
1. **Markov Blankets**: The concept of Markov blankets can be analogized to a cell membrane or the skin, which separate internal states from external environments while allowing selective interaction[5].
2. **Generative Models**: Generative models in biology can be compared to AI systems, where both aim to predict and simulate complex environments to guide actions[5].

#### Mapping Familiar Frameworks to FEP Concepts
1. **Predictive Coding**: Predictive coding can be mapped onto FEP by understanding how prediction errors drive both perception and learning in biological systems[5].
2. **Bayesian Inference**: Bayesian inference can be connected to FEP through the variational Bayesian perspective on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs)[5].

### Learning Challenges
