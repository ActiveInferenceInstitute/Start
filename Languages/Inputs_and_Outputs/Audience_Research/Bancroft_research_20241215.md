### Conceptual Bridges

#### Connecting to FEP/Active Inference
1. **Mentoring as Active Inference:** Mentoring can be seen as an active inference process where mentors gather information to improve their generative models of mentees' needs and abilities.
2. **Cultural Context in Generative Models:** Indigenous cultural contexts can be integrated into generative models to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce uncertainty in educational settings.
3. **Holistic View of Free Energy Minimization:** The holistic view of interconnectedness can be applied to understand how minimizing free energy in one domain (e.g., academic performance) can positively impact other domains (e.g., cultural thriving).

#### Analogies and Metaphors
1. **Mentoring as Navigation:** Mentoring can be likened to navigation, where mentors help mentees navigate through educational challenges by refining their generative models of the environment.
2. **Cultural Pride as Model Evidence:** Promoting cultural pride can increase model evidence for Indigenous students' generative models of their identity and heritage.

#### Mapping Familiar Frameworks to FEP Concepts
1. **Predictive Coding in Education:** Predictive coding principles can be applied in educational settings to predict student performance and adjust teaching strategies accordingly.
2. **Active Inference in Mentoring:** Active inference can guide mentoring practices by encouraging mentors to act on their predictions about mentees' needs and abilities.

#### Highlighting Overlapping Principles and Methodologies
1. **Bayesian Model Selection in Education:** Bayesian model selection principles can be used in education to balance model complexity and accuracy, ensuring that educational strategies are both effective and efficient.
2. **Generative Models in Cultural Preservation:** Generative models can be used to preserve Indigenous cultures by predicting and simulating cultural practices and traditions.

#### Building Progressive Understanding Paths
1. **From Cultural Context to Generative Models:** Start with the importance of cultural context in education, then move to how generative models can be used to integrate cultural knowledge into educational practices.
