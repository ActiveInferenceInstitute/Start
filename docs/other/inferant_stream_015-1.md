## "START/HERE: A Map & What Might Happen Next"

Repo: [https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/Start/](https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/Start/)

Docs: [../index.md](../index.md)

Date/Time: September 3, 5:00–6:00pm PT

## Agenda

- Welcome & context
- Where we are going today:
  1. What is "start here"? This repo:
     - gives an interactive and well-linked landing page into the Active Inference Ecosystem and Institute
     - renders into local documentation and GitHub Pages
     - uses Generative AI to write custom curriculum tailored to our specific research interests in
     - helps us clone and deploy repos
  2. Those repos include various Active Inference open source repositories (PyMDP, ActiveInference.jl, RxInfer.jl, AXIOM), and emerging tools (GNN, Lean_Niche, CEREBRUM)
  3. And....
     - For multiple Active Inference open source repositories (PyMDP, ActiveInference.jl, RxInfer.jl) I have added many educational examples and content in forks

For the rest of the session we will go through roughly the above, plus any questions or comments raised during the stream.

## Themes & Ideas

- start → here → now
- Cartographic pluralism ("A" map, not "The" map)
- Open Source Ecosystems & Cartographic Intelligence (maps of the ecosystem [of maps of minds {that map}])
- Multiple implementation frameworks for Active Inference: many ways to build up along the Low Road
- Shipping the Docs && Doc'ing the Shippment
- From Notes to Navigation: A Site in One Sitting

​Who's map am I building? 
The curriculum that modifies a current mind model?

​So a map outside both the curriculum designer and the curriculum subject?

​Is the limit of my "self-organization" my ability to generate effective prompts? It seems like I'm giving most of the organization tasks over to the processing agent which isn't me. True?

​I see the AI generating and organizing...and shouldn't I practice those tasks too?
