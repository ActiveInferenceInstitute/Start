## Vision
Building an open-source system for generating, analyzing, and visualizing personalized Active Inference "START HERE" curricula across domains, audiences, and languages. 

This is more than just a translation tool - it's a framework for understanding and optimizing how knowledge flows through different perspectives. Modular treatment of topics and perspectives enables flexible application. 

## The Pipeline 

### 1. Domain Research & Perspective Analysis
- Perplexity-powered domain research
- Audience perspective analysis
- Entity folder structure for extensibility

### 2. Curriculum Generation Flow
- Domain-specific content generation
- Audience-adapted writing
- Multi-language translation (85+ languages!)
- Quality checks and refinements

### 3. Visualization Superpowers ðŸš€
- Topic modeling & clustering
- Learning path networks
- Concept mapping & communities
- Quantitative metrics & comparisons

## Stream Segments

### Part 1: The Architecture
- Tour the codebase structure
- Show the entity folder approach
- Demonstrate the pipeline flow
- Preview the visualization outputs

### Part 2: Content Generation
- Domain research script deep dive
- Audience adaptation logic
- Translation system overview
- Quality control mechanisms

### Part 3: Visualization Magic
- Topic distribution heatmaps
- Network visualizations
